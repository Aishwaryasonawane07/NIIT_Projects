       "'__label__1 The Backup Plan: Summer reading that does not require much from the reader. I found the plot unbelievable ~ would a guy wait for you for 10 years? They had not even kept in touch as friends! The romance was too predictable. And treatment for PTSD is a far cry from what was described in this story. I skimmed through a good part of this book just to say I finished it. It simply did not hold my interest.\\n__label__1 would not work with verizon card: I tried to get two of these to work with the Verizon pc5750 card without success even after updating the software. I ended up buying the Linksyswireless-g router for mobile broadband (wrt54g3g-vn)which works well and was priced less. The Linksys did require a software update from the Linksys website.\\n__label__2 A Profound Journey!: Lumari\\'s book, Akashic Records, opened a new way for me to connect with greater wisdom. I immediately felt I was listening to a more intimate conversation with the Keepers of the Akashic. While some books try to explain how to access information from the Akashic, Lumari speaks about the collective itself. In this way, I could feel the energies of the Collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life. I felt like I was invited into the Akashic - to listen, to learn and to understand.This book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness. The energy quality of this book is excellent! The meditation in this book is a profound journey into greater wisdom and spirit. I highly recommend this book and Lumari\\'s other book, Alawashka, too!\\n__label__1 No relief!: The product information says that it takes at least 30 days for this product to work. At 24 days, I was still removing at least 10 fleas from my dog, per day - the same as before I started using Flea Away. I can\\'t believe that 6 more days would have made any difference. And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.\\n__label__1 good for fur bad for keping fleas off: the product did make my pets fur softer but did nothing as far as a flea repellent.\\n__label__1 Alterate time-line for the Marvel mob: Niel Gaiman has created some amazing illustrated fiction, the kind that combines literate storytelling with masterful artwork. I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you\\'re a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel\\'s other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I\\'m afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You\\'ll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird\\n__label__2 No better graphic novel for fans of Marvel and History: By placing some of the best loved Marvel heroes into a historic setting, Gaiman has crafted not only a work of art but also a wonderful playground for some familiar faces to play within.I\\'ll admit, as a Neil Gaiman fan and as a Marvel fan, I was predestined to like this work. If you are either of these things, this is a no-brainer purchase. But even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories, this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price.It would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something. Suffice to say, some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the Marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the 17th century. I should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces. If all you know is the art that appeared in comics in the eighties, you will relish in this advancement.\\n__label__1 work but with some effort: the plastic material is too stiff. i have to put a little more work to get them fit on the cans.\\n__label__1 I didn\\'t buy these....NOTE TO THOSE LOOKING....: I actually bought Petking lids (four pack in colors with paws and tabs) on Ebay. The answer I was looking for was no where to be found. Petking lids said they fit 32 oz and 16 oz cans...which was also no help when I needed them for 5.5 oz Cat Food cans. But...I did find someone to tell me that the lids I bought fit 3 5/8 cans; which is the 5.5 oz size. SO...if you are looking for lids for cat food in the 5.5 oz size Petking can covers Will Work!! : )\\n__label__2 Whoah...: This is my favorite movie, it is so awesome. the fire is really cool, the sound is better, and the band just rocks! For all you people who are afraid to buy the video bcuz of the buck dich scene, i must say - I am 100 % straight and the buck dich thing was the funniest i ever saw, i was laughing for a week. so buy it already! u wont regret it!\\n__label__2 Rammstein Rocks: Never saw Rammstein in whole concert before- only thier videos and one live concert clip where they did some pretty crazy things so i was suprised when i saw this- it was more toned down than i was expecting but still pretty cool with thier flame throwers and pyrotechnics. I dont speak or know that much german but even though i dont know everthing they are saying it still rocked.

Recomended for any rammstein fan or fan of metal.\\n__label__1 read Professor Sherwood\\'s - \" Vindication - a Novel\": In my opinion a better conceptualization Of Mary Wollstonecraft\\'sLife, Ideas, and Experinences is author: Frances SherwoodTile: Vindication.However the Gordon book is an adequate read\\n__label__2 Good resource: I don\\'t actually own this book, but I took it out from the library and enjoyed reading it. The author, who lived in Angola for several years, did a good job of explaining the history of Angola and its people from the first contact with the Portuguese up until the independence. The book explains many of the conflicts Angola has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of colonialism, ethnolinguistic clashes, and the conflict of African and european nationalisms. A good resource for information on how the April 25 Movement in Portugal related to the independence of Angola.\\n__label__2 whimsical \"Life with Father\" set in Tuscany: Frank Schaeffer is great. I realize many think the book is an unfair jab at his family, but speaking from an objective standpoint, the book is damn funny. I grew up in a similar situation, though much less tragic, in Northeastern Italy, and Schaeffer\\'s depiction of the Italian coastal town is beautiful. He correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist Christian home overseas. I do not think I have read a more accurate depiction of being thirteen, in a missionary family, in Italy, and in love. It was a great read.\\n__label__1 ugly shoes: These shoes are comfortable at first but after four hours of dancing, my feet were hurting me, i cant even walk. They are not as cute as the picture either,I was going to return it the first time it came but i dont have the time . Its really ugly, my husband said no no. return it.\\n__label__1 Not Too Great: I personally think there was only one really hot woman in the entire thing. SO much for my expectations.\\n__label__2 GOOD: good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good\\n__label__2 Fantastic Book: I am currently engaged and planning to be married very soon and soon after hope to have children of my own. This is a very inspiring book that gives you a lot to think about on how you might want to raise you kids. It goes through some of her experiences and teaches lesson along the way(great laughs). I have never taken the time to write a review before, but this one is worth it.\\n__label__1 sounds more like l.a. metal: The track Wanted Man sure sound like an L.A. hair metal act, listen to those vocals. They sound much better on Thunderstruck, Riding Free which is more in the vein of euro-metal.Don\\'t be fooled by their Denmark stamp.\\n__label__1 Bad Bad Bad: I had never read a Walter Kirn book before and saw this one at a local bookstore and it looked interesting and it seemed interesting based on what I read standing there. When I got home and started reading it, I was very disappointed.I was so confused and upset because of my confusion that I had a real hard time reading this book. After I finished it, I said \"that is the worst book I have ever read.\"Please don\\'t waste your time or money!\\n__label__1 Nothingness: I wasted $8.00.Rambling writing going nowhere. Expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes.If you happen to see the movie it\\'s obvious the screenwriter(s) didn\\'t think much of it either. The plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense.The author probably doesn\\'t care how his novel was adapted, for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book.\\n__label__1 Platinum Disappointment: Up in the Air is perhaps the best written awful book I\\'ve ever read. Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he\\'s an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There\\'s nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story. But a novel it\\'s not. And the tired little book certainly isn\\'t worthy of all the publicity it\\'s receiving.\\n__label__1 Smug and tedious novel.: Like many other reviewers, I saw the movie first, liked it, and was interested in reading the book. What a disappointment. I found it pretentious and boring. I wasn\\'t interested in any of the characters, all of whom blended for me since they spoke in the same forced dialogue. The whole book felt like the author was showing off but to no effect. I think you could read something like Twilight 10 times and it wouldn\\'t get as boring as this novel the first time.\\n__label__1 Dark Forces 2 Good, Mysteries of Sith Bad: The Dark Forces may be the best first-person action video game, but it gets Marred by MOS. It was too easy to kill myself in MOS simply by force jumping. I died a hundred times because there was something overhead when I jumped. Once I died because I jumped straight up, but took damage from the fall. Another time I was on this ledge and couldn\\'t get back up--every time I jumped, I would bounce off the wall and die. When I went to several web sites to get help on how to get off that ledge, the best that I could find was \\'it is tricky\\' to get off the ledge. After dying several hundred times I got bored and quit. I\\'ve never gone back.\\n__label__2 Wild About THIS Book: I love this book and my son loves this book - but I probably love it more. The librarian accidently? drives the bookmobile into the zoo and before you know it the animals are reading. The rhythm flows nicely and it\\'s clever and the pictures are charming. Big thumbs up!\\n__label__2 Great book for ages 4-7: We read this for my daughter\\'s kindergarten book club. It was SO cute! What a great way to get kids excited about reading. The references to great classic children\\'s book and literature enriches an already fun story. Kids will love to see how the animals at the zoo take to reading. Very cute!\\n__label__2 Do the job very well: These barstools are an excellent value for the price! Easy to set up and they sit very well. We have them for 4 weeks now and use them a lot.\\n__label__2 flawless: this book is worth the $. It describes the concepts perfectly, concisely for the intermediate/advanced student of Spanish to the language\\'s nuances without causing the reader to reach for the dictionary several times over one page. It reviews: how & where consonants are pronounced, vowel sounds, accentuation, plenty of definitions (sonoridad vs sorda, espirantizacion, lenicion, etc) within the first two chapters. The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you\\'re a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others. The one drawback is that it does NOT use international phonetic symbols, but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time.\\n__label__2 Well researched: My wife and I helped Rob with some of the research for the book while we were living on the island of Raiatea in 1994. Most travel writers can only spend a little time actually checking out places to stay and eat. With the research that we were able to do, the reader of this book can be assured that the information hotels, pensions and restaurants on Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa and Maupiti are not only accurate but informed by our personal experiences during a stay of several months.\\n__label__1 Yummy Pictures, Unreliable Recipes: I finally got the book after waiting for a month. The food in the photos all looked so delicious that it made me drool. I was eager to try out the recipes and I thought I start with the Raddish Cake. To my horror, the instructions were unclear! The author did not mention what to do with the raddish! Luckily, I had another book which has a perfect recipe for it. A few days later, I thought I try the Crystal Duck Dumplings and although I followed the instructions perfectly, the dough did not turn out well at all. I think it would be a long time before I would ever try any of the recipes again. Maybe I am just not good at making dim sum.\\n__label__2 i llllloooooovvveeeeeeeee this book and i am 12: i love to read long books and novels but i have to say even though this book is for ages 4-8 i love this book and i am 12 so whho really cares how long it is this is a ssupense filled awsome that you will love love love love love love times 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\\n__label__2 I Certainly Didn\\'t See THAT coming.........: I don\\'t read much fiction so when I find a book I that really holds my attention like \"Temporary Sanity\" did, I take special note.The whole book was woven together very well - I enjoyed each character - even the ones who were created especially so we would be frustrated with them.Marty is very likeable as the able and highly intuitive defense attorney with a heart. I can imagine the small firm she works in is actually a positive place to hang your hat. (This must be fiction *smiling*.)Not only is the writing thoroughly engaging and entertaining, the subject matter is one we can all relate to - in all its horrifying glory.What worked especially well was the ending. I had no clue what was coming. I love when I am taken by surprise like this - kudos to Rose Connors for pulling off such a delightful conclusion.\\n__label__1 mischaracterised internal page conditions: purchased used very good (former library) book, stated as one of best former library books. Book\\'s outside was \\'good\\' not very good. The inside pages were smeared with dried debris, foods, markings, etc. worst used book I ever bought\\n__label__2 Brilliant yet readible!: A masterfully written origins of tantric sexual practicewritten by a professor who does not place himself above his readers.A well researched technical history!!!\\n__label__1 Almost........: The first thing that one must say when reviewing Legally Blond is that the screenwriter(s) for the movie are more talented the Ms Brown. I liked the book on some levels. The plot kept me interested but the writing was not exactly wonderful. At the first page I realized this and wondered if it would be the same the whole way through. It was. The only way to describe the writing is as slightly childish. Even though parts of it were good I could not recommend it. (To all those reading this who loved the book sorry. I always get really angry when someone bashes a book I loved).\\n__label__2 Wonderful book: A treasure! I absolutely love this book about my parents\\' home. Anyone interested in history and legends should get this book.\\n__label__1 Could have been better: This was an interesting book. The writing (and editing) weren\\'t really that great, but I was expecting a bit more substance.The author gave an overview of mercenary operations over an extended period of history and then gave relatively short shrift to current operations, particulalry in Iraq, where PMC\\'s (Private Military Companies) are making sinful amounts of money out of the ongoing debacle in Iraq.The author doesn\\'t appear to have an agenda with this book, other than to get published and make money the sad thing is that with a little more homework and fact checking, he could have done something special.\\n__label__1 Hack job: This book is poorly researched, and in my opinion, poorly written.You would think that because of Fred Rosen\\'s background as an investigative reporter he would have done an in depth investigation of his subject matter. This is not the case.His retelling of the war in Angola is so full of errors and omissions that I don\\'t know why he bothered.Mr. Rosen - next time leave it to Anthony Mockler.\\n__label__1 Quicken forces users to upgrade: Very dissatisfied Intuit forces users to upgrade software to retain the existing service levels. This is due to their \"discontinuation policy\", which ironically will force me to discontinue being their customer. I will not upgrade.\\n__label__1 Worst Version of Quicken ...........EVER!!!!!!!: I have used Quicken since the DOS versions, this one is the worst! You cannot change any colors, period, end of discussion! You cannot remove unused, useless toolbars/frames, period, end of discussion! You will have to call tech support! You will have to endure repeated uninstalls/reinstalls! Download a trial version before you upgrade, if you can\\'t configure it the way you want, delete it and move on!\\n__label__2 Excellent game: Good graphics, good plot, decent puzzles. I pull it out every few months and go through the whole thing again. It never gets boring. The extra missions that can be downloaded from Lucasarts are really good, too.\\n__label__2 Fun -- but could be better: This game is a great game for people who enjoy basic \"blast the bad guys into oblivion\" setup. The levels are intriguing and all very unique, but some can get very boring after a while of running around trying to find some hidden door that does nothing other than allow you to get to the next level. But there are good aspects to the game such as --i think-- 9 different types of weapons to choose from, along with great and funny sounds to go along with them. Buy it if you like, but beware, there are a lot of time wasting stages to go through, so if you are buying for pure enjoyment and not time wasting, be careful--get some cheats to let you skip levels or something..\\n__label__2 Best eye drops!: I tend to wake up with dry, goopy eyes, and these mixed with the allergy drops completely fix the problem. My eyes aren\\'t dry and they don\\'t itch. I would much prefer to by these, for 14 dollars for the two of them then spend 25 dollars on a copay for prescription ones that are only .25 ounces. I love that they are natural. They don\\'t burn or sting like some of the other OTC eye drops. I recommend them completely.\\n__label__1 Works but expires 7 days or something after opened!: If i known this expires a week after opening i would of not bought it! It might be earlier then 7 days not sure but i was pretty upset i wasted $8 to put drops in once! If they expire this short of a time make it little packets or something what a waste of a product.... I bought this thinking if it comes back i can use it again later and makes up for the high price. Also the box is also different what false advertising this product is! So much lies and hidden info not mentioned.\\n__label__2 Great a/c for a small price.: Iwas plesantly suprised how well the unit cools my large bedroom.The de-humidefier cycle works great itmakes the air feel lite and fresh.The thermostat works properly and the unit was relatively easy to install.I can\\'t imagine thatanother unit for twice the price would be any better.\\n__label__1 Compressor works but no freon in system 5 year warrany on sealed system where?: Tried manufacture got hung up on then now told this is the old model the new one is like a aes3105. Frigeration Tech looked and turned on unit only saying it has a system leak or freon not installed, so it will not get cold. Now maybe because it\\'s a older model we can not get a replacement from seller maybe because it was a older model setting around and thus reason for problem in the first place. Now I had a guy install unit modify window to fit their unit and can not get warrantied as maker only changes smaller units out. Seller will not replace with current model aes3105 even though unit they sold me is defective and non-functional couple years old according to maker of units. It will only blow warm air nothing close to cold with out freon. Maker said unit is a couple year older model and they will only exchange it a 4 week process in the middle of coming summer in OK. Sucks\\n__label__2 Exactly what I needed for my class: Perfect condition. Used it for Devry sociology class. The class itself used the book 50% and class readings 50%. The book met all of my needs.\\n__label__1 all talk, no data: A couple of good articles on primer testing but otherwise this book was almost devoid of any data. It was just a few guys sitting around talking. I regret buying it.\\n__label__2 Excellent!: This is an excellent guide for the young horse owner. Our daughter just got her first horse and this guide will teach her much about caring for her horse.\\n__label__2 danger: This book is a great book to read because it is adventurous. This book is about a gril that gets her fortune told.The fortune teller tells her that her brother is in trouble.So she sets out to find her little brother.On the way she has an adventure and some trouble. If you want to read an adventurous book you should definitely pick this book.\\n__label__2 Found it by chance, opened my eyes to male sexuality: I could not put this book down for a minute and I could not beleive that a male author could write so eloqently, sexually and emotionally, about his love for women. The novel was very moving and I\\'m looking for other books by Butler with erotic themes.\\n__label__2 Butler is a writer to watch: The protagonist of this wonderful novel is by no means a misogynist. He is a man who truly loves women, and as we learn of his past loves, we are blessed with a paen to the many ways men cherish women. Butler possesses a fantastic eye, and THEY WHISPER is a kaleidoscope of love.\\n__label__2 Delightful, Delicous, EASY!!!: I just bought this cookbook after a friend\\'s recommendation. A novel concept! The book is divided into 3 flip sections...so you can open it up and BAM! you\\'ve got a great dinner menu. The instructions are so easy to follow and the author gives suggestions on which dishes to pair together. I love it!\\n__label__1 Painfully Bad: I regret to say that this was a boring disappointment, not even anything about which to rant, other than it\\'s astounding suchaverage rehash makes it to a book.\\n__label__2 great sound: Great sound.. much better than the stock ipod earphones or buds.Knocked off one point because they are slightly too large. The sound more than makes up for the slightly larger size.Considering the price and sound quality they are a steal.\\n__label__1 Poor: I bought these because my sony earbuds (Fontopoia with bass nipple) I have had for 7 years finally died. These MX 500 retail for $42 here in Aus, and i can say that i was severely dissapointed in the sound quality for the price. How much do i have to pay for a decent sound? must be close to $100 or more, for these flimsy peices of plastic?!!! I am returning them as i expected more from a brand such as sennhheiser. The sound was weak. No presence in the highs or any bass. All nasty mids. These will be the last earbbud style headphones i ever bother with.\\n__label__1 This went nowhere: After reading so much about the book in the NYT, i was hoping it would pick up at some point, however it didn\\'t. Even at the end when you think it may, it still falters... Sorry, spend your time reading something else.\\n__label__1 I guess I\\'m not qualified: This is one of those books reading fans are supposed to like. Critics gave it glowing reviews and it was featured as a notable book of the year for the NYTimes. Unfortunately I found it uninteresting and boring. Plus the main character Misha flat out annoyed me and I was hoping for him to get blown up.I must be missing something or not qualified to read this novel, but to me it an excersise in trying to hard.\\n__label__2 Belkin ExpressCard: My Ethernet port did not work any longer. I use this computer for my business and cannot afford to be out of commission. I received the Belkin ExpressCard, loaded the driver and was ready to go. It has worked with no incident and at $10 it saved me from purchasing a new computer. It was a win-win all around for me. I had ordered another ExpressCard through Amazon but it was the wrong product. Amazon\\'s return policy is great. The return process was safe, fast and extremely effective. I will definitely continue using Amazon as my first point of contact for future purchases and look at Belkin for any future needs.\\n__label__2 Belkin Gigabit Ethernet ExpressCard: I just finished installing this Gigabit Ethernet adapter in an aging WinXP Dell laptop connected to our Gigabit wired Ethernet home network, and the super easy install took less that five minutes. The increase in speed over the previous 10/100 Intel Ethernet network adapter was astonishing -- I measured 20 Mb/s download speed from our local Cox IP with our old Dell laptop (that is 2X the download speed with the 10/100 adapter). Only negative I can see is that it appears not to have drivers for Win 7.\\n__label__2 I like it!: Purchased this for 14-year-old band student. Works great in the Texas heat. No leakage, comfortable to wear, keeps water cool. She gives it 5 stars. Works as well as camelbak at lower price point.\\n__label__2 sultry noir music: Perfect background music for those of us who love film noir.Sexy,sultry,evocative.Musicians are wonderful,and the audio quality is perfect.So..slip into something more comfortable,and watch for (your) Bogie or Bacall to walk in the door!\\n__label__2 One of the coolest techno songs ever: If you are looking for a cool techno/trance song then this is definitely one of them. I didn\\'t care too much for the last two mixes but the rest (especially the second track) are great. The first time I heard this song was in the movie Formula 51 during the club sequence. I spent forever trying to find this song but finally found it here on Amazon. Get this cd if not only to get a good song but to burn music from this disk to make your own trance collection (which I did). Buy this, you won\\'t regret it.Also, I recommend to anyone else who likes this music get The Thrillseekers cd Synathaesia. It has the mix used in Formula 51 as well.\\n__label__2 Classic Warren Miller: Could have done a better job remastering from VHS to DVD. With that being said, it\\'s still classic Warren Miller and as the saying goes \"there ain\\'t none better\"\\n__label__2 Case Management Review: This was a required book for a case management class. It was an easy read. It is a good resource book for case managers and for people (like me) who had no prior knowledge of case management. The language and explanations were easy to understand.\\n__label__2 Great zombie flick: This is a great movie for the zombie buff. it\\'s a serious movie and although I didn\\'t like the end much i thought the ford brothers did an awesome job with it. Great quality production with the slower moving zombies like Romero.A must watch for the zombie fan.\\n__label__1 Terrible.: The movie had a very basic storyline, and ended on a note that didn\\'t make sense at all. Africa is huge, and the idea that every square inch of this country he is in is swarming with the undead is highly unlikely especially due to the fact that I can low crawl faster than these zombies walk. Parts of this movie are decent but the majority of it sucks. If you want to watch a good zombie flick, click next, try something else. 4/10\\n__label__2 Actually pretty good!: It is more focused on character than pure action, but it has plenty of action nonetheless. I was entertained and i hope they do a sequel.\\n__label__1 Really???: Really I know there are alot of Zombie Movies out there but really come on limited bullets so lets shot them Zombies in the belly, leg, arm everywhere but the HEAD the Head is what you need to shot this Movie is no Walking Dead lots of blood and eatting bodys but if you know a blow to the head is what kills them get it done...Big thumbs down\\n__label__2 a grand conclusion for a classic epic: yes I read others writing that they found it shallow or unrealistic unreasonable etc...but for me I found it thrilling exciting and nail biting.I switches back to Jarad as a focal character and his bonding with an eagle which portends war. Along with another mage from a rival league. Civil war breaks out as an evil ghost takes over the power stone of the mages. In the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm.I love the combination of technology and magecraft. High tech verses an agrigarian society. I see the writers soap box platform on saving our old growth forest. I live in the pacific north west and have experienced it a lot and agree.I look forward to his next book. I find him a fascinating writer with thoughtful insight and three deminsional characters. A real flare for style.\\n__label__2 Eagle-Sage: As the third book in the series, it was good, but not as good as the prior two. There was a certain tenseness missing that had been in the previous books. It was good, though, to finish the story line, and worth the price.\\n__label__1 Worst Ending ever: This is by far one of the WORST endings I have ever read. The first book may have been good, but Coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems, characters, or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting. The magic system was vague (which is fine for a first novel, but by the conclusion I want some explanation) and unimaginative, as were many of the characters. The book\\'s outcome was extaordinarily predictable. If you have liked this series so far, don\\'t destroy your image with this book.\\n__label__2 The best money I\\'ve spent on music in a while!: I was looking for a nice TMBG compilation to share with my sons (ages 11, 6 and 5) and came across this set- and at a FABULOUS price on Amazon- and am pretty sure it was the best money I\\'ve spent on music in a while. Great quality, nice collection of TMBG classics... and my boys have already memorized and are singing along to \"Why Does the Sun Shine?\" I am a proud, happy mother. :)\\n__label__1 D.O.A.: The acting lacked a lot in this movie and the plot lacked direction. This is one of those films that could have at one point had potential but fell way short when actually done. I normally enjoy Lucy Liu in films but not this time. It just didn\\'t make the grade and fell way short of my expectations.\\n__label__1 Save your money! This movie SUCKS!!!!!: This movie was a waste of time...the only thing that made it watchable was Lucy Lui naked...that\\'s it. And whats a Vampire movie with no fangs?\\n__label__1 Danger--do not buy this product: We bought this tea kettle to match our Friendly Village dish pattern. We especially wanted a whistling tea kettle. Well, it did not whistle. We filled it with water and went about our household business. We were sitting in the next room when we smelled something burning. We rush back to the kitchen. The water had evaporated, the kettle never whistled. Its bottom melted and it ruined the stove heating coil and drip collar. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.\\n__label__2 I Love It: This Is A Realy Great Album By Merle Haggard. For The Fans Of Merle, This Album Is A -Must Have.\\n__label__2 The Hag is Back: Best vocals I have heard Merle record since the mid-eighties. I thought, due to age, and other elements, that his voice was headed down-hill. I don\\'t know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch. In my opinion this album as a whole, contains his best music in twenty years. None of the songs stand-out above the rest, but they are all solid. His past 5-6 studio albums contain 1-2 great songs surrounded by very bland ones. Recent albums may have had good lyrics, but the music doesn\\'t stand up to the standards Merle has set in the past. \"Chicago Wind\" is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this.It is a shame that most C&W; radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political, social, economic or environmental issues.\\n__label__2 Getting over the clouds...: William Kershner is a technical author with a flair for humor that is reminiscent of Samuel Clements. His writings are clear, instructional, and pure reading enjoyment. Bill\\'s latest work, \"Logging Flight Time\" is a core book for the libraries of true pilots everywhere. It also is a MUST for non-fliers who might like insight into those individuals who lived during an era when aviators were heroes.Kershner\\'s crisp collection of events from his career will appeal to all who have any fascination for the sheer fun and wonder of flight.\\n__label__1 I\\'d be humiliated if I was the pilot in this book: The author gives a bad name to professional pilots. The antics of the characters in this book would only appeal to young guys who like to party and drink. Everyone has to start somewhere so maybe the author will improve as he goes along.\\n__label__1 Perhaps the lowest quality CD ever released?: Could not wait for this CD to arrive at my office, being a huge Duke fan. Popped it in my car CD player on the way home from work. I assumed my CD player or speakers had experienced a total melt-down. The sounds on all tracks were so thin and tinny they sounded like a telephone call. So, I checked this CD on two more players. SURPRISE! It wasn\\'t the hardware, it was the CD. I own thousands of CDs and have never, ever heard a recording this poorly engineered and presented. That sent me back to listen to the Amazon samples. This CD has exactly that same horrible level of recording as the samples. DO NOT BUY THIS CD under any circumstances. It is totally useless, unless you are searching for a new drink coaster.\\n__label__2 Final Cut Live Rocks: This Cd is worth buying for the Final Cut live,the live version of the song FInal Cut is an expirence not given in many of coheed\\'s other songs, the live version gives you an extened song with more and better solos.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t be fooled!: Don\\'t be fooled by the well known actors and the Academy Award Nomination. This one is really, really bad. The camera, music and story just float all over the place. Unless you like these surreal type of movies you will be fast asleep within 15-20 minutes.In all fairness I think this is another movie that some will get and others will not get. Seven Psychopaths is a similar type of movie.Maybe this type of movie is for you, but I have no patience for this slow moving type of story.\\n__label__2 Open Your Mind: Joaquin Phoenix is the main reason I watched this movie. It\\'s his first serious acting role since his whole rap documentary hoax I\\'m Still Here. (I thought I\\'m Still Here was pretty ballsy.) And no regrets because Joaquin blew me away. People don\\'t realize his acting depth. Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it\\'s slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman\\'s acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well. This movie is definitely an acquired taste.Go into this movie with the acting in mind, not so much the plot or the cinematography or visuals.\\n__label__1 Prepare to be bored out of your mind.: We rented this movie because of the Academy Award nominations for Joaquin. He did do great job in that aspect but otherwise the movie is very boring.\\n__label__1 Joaquin Phoenix is great. The film is terrible.: Director Paul Thomas Anderson once again proves that he is incapable of telling a compelling story.Anderson is great with a camera and Phoenix is seething in his portrayal of an alcoholic wanderer...But there is no story here. The second half of the film is just a boring wasteland of wandering.Awful film.\\n__label__1 One Star is Generous: Zero stars. I felt compelled to write a review to save people from wasting their time and money on this garbage. I had the misfortune of seeing this movie today with my husband and we both couldn\\'t believe what a horribly written and misogynistic movie this was! Literally people were walking out left and right. The movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused. The ending was flat, like the storyline, and at the end of the movie my husband said, \"Well, that was a waste of two hours,\" and the couple behind us said, \"We were just saying the same thing.\"Save yourself the time, and frustration, and skip this one!\\n__label__1 FYI This DVD is not very good at all.: I love to dance, so I picked up this video thinking it would be a fun way to work out. Boy was I wrong. Its very boring, it takes them forever to teach you the moves, then you go through it fast paced a few times and you are on to the next one. I used it once, got halfway through and shut it off. I dont know why they would ever describe this as a workout. If i were you I would shell out the extra 5 bucks and get a better fitness DVD.\\n__label__1 Boring: I am not really athletic person, and I am not in a great shape, recently after pregnancy. I haven\\'t worked out for quite a bit and this work out barely made me sweat. Plus it was quite boring and very repetitive. For person like me any better work out probably would cause some sore muscles, etc, but this did not. If you want fun and little more sweat, I would suggest Carmen Electra\\'s striptease workout. I used disc No 1, it was really much easier to repeat, and I sweat a lot more, and got a little of sore muscles in my legs next day. And Carmen has much better and warmer personality than Robin from PCD.\\n__label__2 Fun: a very fun work out, it is so much fun you dont realize you are working out. i use this dvd every day\\n__label__2 PCD Makes You DANCE!: I was skeptical about what this DVD actually had to offer however, now that I have it I couldn\\'t be more happy with my purchase! This DVD teaches you how to loosen up and be cute and playful or a little playfully sexy. The dance choreography is easy to learn and a lot of fun; it\\'s not like some of those other workout DVD\\'s that have you moving in awkward moves that you wouldn\\'t be caught dead doing in front of a mirror much less at a club! You definitely get cardio time and a ton of cute moves from clips of, \"Dontcha\", \"Buttons\" and a super cute burlesque piece.\\n__label__2 22 pounds lost in 4 weeks !: I have read some of the reviews and noticed that some people said it is too slow? let me tell you, this workout is fast paced, unless you\\'re just standing there and berly moving i can see how you wont break a sweat but by the end of the workout my clothes is dripping with sweat. I did this workout for 4 weeks exactly mo- fri and i lost 22 pounds and Im still going to keep doing it. you have to really move like the girls in the video to get results, these girls that don\\'t like the video must not now how to move at all !\\n__label__2 Love it: Love the sexy moves, great to get your heart pumping and it\\'s empowering! I\\'m a plus size girl and I enjoy it.\\n__label__2 Spider-Man 3 Peel & Stick Wall Border: Product delivered fast and it was easy to peel and stick on the wall. Great product for price. No problems with it adhering to the wall and my son loves his spiderman room!\\n__label__1 Looks really nice, if you can get it to stay in place.: I was very excited to put this border up in my son\\'s room. It took me about 2 hours to get it perfect. We went out for a couple of hours and when I returned home, I went in to the room to check out my handy work, it was all on the floor. I have had other peel and stick and have stayed on. Perhaps I just got 4 bad rolls, or this product just doesn\\'t stick.I was very dissappointed. I gave it one star on appearance. Now I\\'m nervous about purchasing another peel and stick product.\\n__label__2 eye pillow doggie: gifted this to a dog lover friend and she LOVED it! only downside was that i\\'m not sure i had the option to \\'gift\\' this purchase so perhaps my giftee found out how much her christmas gift cost this year!\\n__label__2 Tres De Cafe Y Dos De Azucar: This cd is one of three recordings that the duo of Pacheco and El Conde made in thier early years while together. It\\'s great like their other albums the Combo do an outstanding job musically. This masterpiece was first released in 1973, but the swing is still there and will have you dancing to its beat. Highly recommend for that swinger in you.\\n__label__1 a bunch of overated sacriligious garbage: South Park is a show that everyone seems to love. I love Family Guy with its \"adult humor\" but I seriously found no humor in South Park. I tried to get into it, but all the jokes were lame, stupid, and the characters were annoying with their weird shapes and annoying voices. On top of it, the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious. Jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked? Come on! The passion of the Jew? This is trash and I\\'m ashamed that our country enjoys it. So, you know what, give me 0 out of 800 helpful votes because all of you love it but at least, I spoke my thoughts on this awful show.\\n__label__1 Dissapointed: The tree arrived with a broken base and in really bad shape (have picture to proof it). The bonsai was trimmed to early so during the trip lost its natural beauty. It was a present for a friend and she was obliged to return it due to its bad quality.\\n__label__2 A straightforward, specialized genealogy reference: World War II Military Records: A Family Historian\\'s Guide is a straightforward, specialized genealogy reference and instructional guide to finding and interpreting key information from military personnel records, casualty reports, WW II draft registrations, burial sites, awards and medals, and more. An excellent tool for anyone interested in genealogy or military research, World War II Military Records is an important addition to both Genealogy and Military Studies reference collections.\\n__label__1 Incomplete Patterns: There were no top views of any of the many bird patterns in this book.All the fish patterns had top views. I was disappointed and tried to call Al. He provided a phone number in the back of the book and that number was disconnected.If it had top views of the birds like it did for the fish, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. I carved the catfish and was pleased with how the book walked through that project.I have not carved any of the birds though and that is why I bought this book.\\n__label__1 disappointed in this one: Didn\\'t like this book as well as the Little Soul and the Sun. As we had a home birth and this book is all about a baby born into the hospital. Also the book ends abruptly, kind of odd.....like there should be another chapter atleast.\\n__label__2 Very informative and interesting.: Great read for an anthropology class of the late 90s. \"The West\" and \"the rest\" are examined well in terms of race and gender.\\n__label__2 Advance wall clock, 10\": I like it. Seems well made. I use it in my shop which gets very cold in the winter and too warm in the summer. So far, no problems with it.\\n__label__1 The Music is Beyond Repair: With one or two isolated exceptions, these compositions are astonishingly boring. If you purchase the recording anyway, be warned that 22 out of 24 tracks are likely to disappoint.\\n__label__2 Good Chow: This is one of the best dog food\\'s I have gotten yet.My dog likes it and it is good for him.My Vet. said it is good brand also. Cost a little more,but if I eat the best why shouldn\\'t my dog???\\n__label__1 incredible fabrications of history: Does she know anything about Japan\\'s wartime history? Just google \"Unit 731,\" the place where her own daddy probably worked at. Is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable, inhuman experiments took place?\\n__label__2 A reader from, Harare, Zimbabwe, March 28, 1999: I really injoyed this book. I just read it, for class book reading. I found some parts in the book that were very sad, but not sad enough for tears. This book was one of the books that I cant put down. Once I was into the 3 chapter i couldn\\'t stop reading the book. I will never forget that I read this book as a young kid.\\n__label__2 This book is compelling, realistic, and unforgettable.: This book is compelling, a page-turner, realistic and unforgettable.\\n__label__2 A Learning Experience: This was a very good book. When I found out later that this book was recommended for children and young adults to read I was very surprised. I\\'m not sure if a child would be able to take the emotional heartbreak of this story. But, as for adults, it was very informative and touching. I cried when reading some parts and knowing that when you are living it, you cannot just stop living it, you must go on. The writing is exceptional, not sentimental or romanticized like some books. I looked at the world in a new way after reading this. I don\\'t think my struggles can ever be as bad and if they are I know I can handle them if the girl in this story could.\\n__label__1 Costly piece of Junk!!: My daughter got this from her grandparents for a birthday present. I am not a seamstress, but I know how to set up a sewing machine properly. My daughter spent hours trying to figure this thing out. I managed to get everything set up except for the bobbin area. I managed to snap the thread 6 times and still have not been able to thread it effectively. This really isn\\'t the best machine to be learning on, go to a thrift store and purchase one from there instead or try your local freecycle. I think her grandparents paid $50 CDN, total waste-o-money. We cant even send it back because we mangled the box trying to get to the machine. I give this 0 out of 5 stars, don\\'t waste your money on this mess.\\n__label__1 hawaiian umbrella tree: This item was very dissappointing, I returned this item and still no one will credit my account, the tree was broke and dead when this arrived!\\n__label__1 Muppet show: music mayhem and crap!: misrepresented. The sales pitch makes it seem like a dvd, with maybe a few episodes or muppet music videos. But no its a crappy music CD with lame songs that are no fun to listen to without watching them performed. I was way disapointed.\\n__label__2 class text: bought this book for a class. World economics: history and theory. it is a heavy read and contains good information.\\n__label__2 The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by Landes: It was one of the most entertaining books I\\'ve ever read.The insight and attempt at explaining the causes of wealth creation met with my (limited) understanding of the issue, much more so than Jared Diamond\\'s geographical emphasis.I keep buying copies as a gift for people with a genuine interst in the topic and have not met with any disappointments.\\n__label__1 A pathetic conclusion to a once-great series.: The first two games in the Monkey Island series were fresh, funny, and inventive. The Curse of Monkey Island is none of these things. Rather, it feels like a harsh and manufactured attempt to recreate what made the first two games so great. It does not succeed. Without Ron Gilbert, and without the slightest idea of what the first two games were about, The Curse of Monkey Island, had it been called something else (as it should have) might have been okay. But its poor graphics, mostly unfunny humor, and theme completely foreign to the series make it a game no fun of the series should bother to play. If you\\'ve never heard of Monkey Island before, it may be worth it, but it\\'s not likely.\\n__label__1 Does not support UPS to power it: If you buy this don\\'t expect to power it with a UPS. I hooked mine up with a APC 1500 UPS with an attached additional battery pack for extended life. When i had the first power outage all went fine until the power came back on and it the UPS switched to utility power from battery back up and the Monster went through a full reset causing all of the connected devices to have to be reprogrammed. Monster said that they did not support their device on a UPS. So I have a Monster HTS 3600 for a door stop. Absolutely worthless to me\\n__label__2 Best purchas in a long time.: I recently purchased a new Denon 2809 receiver for my home theater to replace a Marantz that did not do HDMI switching. When I hooked up my Samsung Blu-ray and Toshiba HD-DVD player the picture looked good, but when I connected my PS3, red lines appeared on my tv. I tried different HDMI cables, including Monster cables that were over one hundred dollars, but still saw red lines. My last resort was change from a cheap surge protector to this power center. After purchasing Monster Reference center the red lines disappeared and all video signals looked much better. Sound quality also improved. I am going to buy another one for my bedroom setup!\\n__label__2 Excellent Product: I was a bit leery after reading some of the reviews about this product but I can say that it has made a profound improvement in the sound and the picture quality of my home theater system. No longer do I hear the occasional popping sounds on the audio of most of our HDTV stations. The video has much less horizontal streaking. My experience with my wife listening was similar to other reviewers. She confirmed my observations spontaneously. I suppose that the degree of improvement must vary with the amount of signal noise that is present in the buyer\\'s home area.\\n__label__1 China Mfg. meter: I must say I was not impressed with the overall quality of the units at all, the internal electronics looked to be of very poor assembly and quality. I had recently purchased two similar units which I returned due to the fact they did not operate properly.I have learned my lesson, No more cheap products from China when possible!\\n__label__2 Good Adaptation of a Superb Novel: The National TreeDavid Kranes\\' outstanding novel, The National Tree, finds a solid adaptation in this Hallmark production. The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President\\'s lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored. Kranes\\' characteristic gentle and offbeat humor comes through so much more completely in the book which has become a family Christmas Classic for so many people.\\n__label__1 tired rehash of father-son bonding scenario: I\\'m sorry but there was just nothing original or noteworthy about this film about a father and son who learn to \\'bond\\' while taking their family\\'s tree to be planted in Washington DC. Along the way the boy meets up with his online girl \\'friend\\' who decides to tag along, without Dad knowing... and gruff Dad starts having feelings for the go-getter PR woman (and vice-versa) traveling behind them arranging for media attention. The plot was predictable from the get-go, and the acting was uninspired.... about as \\'wooden\\' as the tree they are carrying in the back of the big rig. Mediocre Hallmark viewing here; certainly NOT worth buying the dvd in my humble opinion.\\n__label__2 National Tree- Patriotism-: Feel good story about the National Christmas tree. Also, the story of a man accepting the maturity of his son and watching what he has taught him prevail when the time was right. Great Xmas movie, men and ladies. One of my favorites.\\n__label__2 Improvise by Mick Napier: A decent book that gives different types of ideologies for Improvisation. The book is pretty much 100% opinion but I still enjoyed the author\\'s insightful observations and \"solutions\" to repetitive improv habits.Worth the money.\\n__label__2 Get it - and get it right!: Why can\\'t anyone list this wonderful little HD TV correctly. I purchased one at \"Wally World\" and it works GREAT! The sound is very good too. It has the normal HD TV inputs plus the ATSC tuner. And it even has VGA input so I can connect it to my notebook PC and watch my MLB.com baseball games on a better screen.This is a true HD TV. The resolution is 850:1 an NOT the 400:1 as shown in Amazon.com.Buy this for your bedroom or any small room application. It\\'s great!\\n__label__1 Dead TLA-01911C: TLA-01911C Dead. I bought this TV used from a friend, but with the manufacture date of 2007 I never figured a name brand TV would just die after a few years. After reading other comments I noticed all the warning signs... The screen would freeze while watching digital cable. After the freezes become more frequent, startups started to take longer. During the slow startups the screen would seem fuzzy, with bands of the picture being out of whack. It would take longer and longer for the TV to be clear after startup, then the screen became white. The TV would no longer work, It would just be a white screen with lines in it.SO DO NOT BUY, IT WILL BREAK, AND IT WILL BREAK SOON. I seem to be one of the lucky ones, as others broke within the warranty period and had to deal with horrible tech support.\\n__label__2 Dr. Mercola\\'s Total Health Program: The Proven Plan to Prevent Disease and Premature Aging, Optimize Weight and Live Longer: I have not finished reading the book but what I have read so far is very interesting.\\n__label__2 Wonderful health book!!!: I borrowed this book from a neighbor and loved it so had to own it. I am looking forward to finding out my metabolic type as well. It\\'s good to see that he doesn\\'t advocate every supplement on the planet thereby breaking you but uses a few crucial ones. Hopefully this book will help my change my food lifestyle and add years to my life.\\n__label__1 1 star, because there is no choice for less: This book is a waste of time and money. It is a gathering of other\\'s work that he has obviously copied without proper references. A small article could encompass the whole book. Also I found his recipes so unpractical and without a proper study, as they do not show any nutritious data about them. The recipes are an advertisement for Mercola\\'s store.This book tries to lure people into buying Mercola\\'s products. I consider it a rip-off rather that a helpful book. I like Dr. Weil better as he is more earthbound and practical.\\n__label__2 Best Of Show Nutritionally: Dr. Mercola has worked long and hard to get the word out that it matters what you eat. Yes, it does matter what you eat. Want to live a long, healthy life? Eat according to the program laid out in this book. Want to avoid cancer, heart disease and diabetes? Eat according to the program laid out in this book. As a health author, nutritional consultant and colon hydrotherapist, there are few other mentors who have taught me more than Dr. Joseph Mercola.Kristina Amelong, CNC, CTwww.optimalhealthnetwork.com\\n__label__2 Great beginning but lost some of the magic as the story developed...: The first couple of chapters of this book had me completely mesmorized, the instant attraction to one another, the Fae mysteries working their magic and a soul that badly needed to be healed... It had the makings of a book that one would read and re-read until the pages fell from the book from overuse but all too quickly it went downhill.Deborah MacGillivray was on the right track early on but it became boring and repetative all too quickly. I plan to read more of her books, she started out captivating the reader but that captivation turned into repetition, there is only so much excitement that one can draw from an apple tree no matter how ancient and powerful it may be.\\n__label__1 I really tried...: I tried. I really really tried to read this book. I forced myself to read more than half of it, but then I had to give up. The plot was boring and I felt like I have read it a billion other times in a billion other boring books. The dialogue was awful, the characters were flat.\\n__label__1 Too Difficult for Lower-level Spanish Readers: I am in a Spanish 4 class in college, yet I found this book still too difficult to read. I also expected it not to be as long--I was looking for a book that was only around 25 pages.\\n__label__2 Fantastic Book!: Most books assume that the reader has a month to carefully read the book. In reality, the reader often has a day or two and needs a solid understanding of the material but not a really detailed understanding. This book is great because it quickly and clearly covers all of the necessary concepts. What else can you ask for?\\n__label__1 How do you use this to teach Spanish?: I borrowed this set from the library. After reading through the introduction and then listening to a couple of the tracks on the CD, I have no idea how you\\'re supposed to use this to teach Spanish. If there was a picture for each phrase, then maybe I could understand, but there\\'s not. Between high school and college, I took five years of Spanish, so my non-understanding is not from not knowing any Spanish. I\\'m going to keep looking.\\n__label__1 Did not like it at all: I thought this was going to have lots of songs and it did not. It only has a few songs and the rest is 2 people reading off the book. Very boring.\\n__label__1 Not yet received the item: I have not received this item yet. Its been over a month since I placed the order. Is it not available?\\n__label__1 Too complex: Not good as a primary text for teaching Spanish at home. Songs are very complicated with lots of difficult vocabulary, while children may learn to sing a song they certainly are not going to know what it means. I am going to be looking for something else to use - very disappointed since some of the other reviewers suggested this would be a good tool to use at home.\\n__label__1 Surprisingly disappointing: First, I just want to say that I love Diana Palmer. She is fabulous and fun, one of my favorites. This book was NOT Diana Palmer material. It is about a young girl who falls in love with an older man and waits a year for him until he over comes his wife\\'s death. In the meantime, Brianne\\'s horrible step father promises her hand in marriage to someone else and Brianne will do everything she can to keep from marrying this evil man, with the help of Peirce if he gets over his wife\\'s death. I could hardly stand Pierce for he was boring, self centered and childish. And though Brianne was not as naive as one would think, she was still not a very bright young woman. I found the plot somewhat weak, even though Ms. Palmer snuck in a few surprises with the oil companies and wars and etc. I found Tate Winthrop more exciting than anyone in this book and he was hardly in it!! I know the next book I read by her will be much better. I am not giving up on her! :)\\n__label__1 I feel gross.: Scratches seemed like an interesting game, a little frustrating, definitely creepy, but I\\'ll never know how it ends. I stopped playing it and never intend to again. I got to the point in the game where you are expected to put a nail in the feet of a statue of Christ to open a secret door and couldn\\'t believe this was actually a part of a GAME.I\\'m not the most devout person in the world, but that just felt utterly wrong. I don\\'t care about the spoiler alert, I wish someone had done the same for me before I wasted time and money.\\n__label__2 No puedes pedir mas por el precio!: Este libro te ayuda a entender la gramatica del lenguaje Ingles y te ayuda a poder hablarlo y escribirlo mejor. Is one of the best tools anyone can have when learning to speak or better english skills.\\n__label__1 Gramatica de la Lengua Inglesa: I find this book quite difficult for the spanish-speaking adult student who I am working with. Any spanish-speaking person would need a high level of education in his own language to comprehend the explanations and directions. My student is perhaps educated through grade school.This would be a good book for someone who is advanced in the spanish language.There are lines for answers, but they are close together, perhaps college-ruled or closer, so the handwriting would have to be fairly small.A good point about this book is that the answers are in the back.There are 127 pages of workbook pages, then there are two appendices and the answers, and one page of an index. Total pages: 143\\n__label__2 The Priests DVD: I can\\'t believe I did not know about this DVD earlier after it was made. I love sacred music and there are many beautiful, inspiring music for the soul. I love concertizing beautiful sacred music which lifts and nourishes the soul whether one attends a church or not. The music speaks for itself, we need more of this type of concerts, the Priests are great, I hope they continue to create more DVDs such as this. Music is another way communicating with God and the joy of the music certainly uplifts every soul who supports good music.\\n__label__2 messenger bag: This bag has been very handy for me not only with class supplies but also for everyday things instead of carrying a purse as well, I just carry this one bag.I\\'ve been able to use it for digital photography class to carry supplies and class instructions and it\\'s very comfortable to walk around San Francisco in.\\n__label__2 Great ideas: Many delicious ice cream recipes in this book, along with other recipes for desserts, drinks, and more. Really helps to understand the basics of making homemade ice cream. Most recipes will make \"a generous 1 quart\" which ends up being approx. 1 1/2 quarts. Prompt shipment and great product!\\n__label__2 The only ice cream recipe book you\\'ll ever need!: Incredible recipes that are impossible to goof. Really challenges quality store bought ice cream\\n__label__2 \"Delicious\" and Fantastic Buy!: The recipes in here are true to the Ben & Jerry\\'s products you find on the frozen section of your grocery store! I easily achieved amazing results with the recipes they provided. (Try the Peanut Butter Fudge Ribbon variation- you will not believe it!). This book is very pratical and written with great humour.I strongly recommend this book to the novice with a sense of adventure as well as for the more experienced Ice Cream epicurian.Sincerely.Blanche, Montreal QC\\n__label__2 Great buy: Great little book to start ice cream making with. The intro is mostly biography, there is a section to better understand ice cream making (key ingredients, why you need to use whole milk as opposed to fat free, etc), and the rest of the book is recipes. They have great techniques, but they are often in sidebars, rather than being on a separate page or chapter. As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn\\'t talk about frozen yogurt. My only problem is that it isn\\'t quite as organized as I would like to get to a specific technique, like adding a fudge swirl to an ice cream. Great buy.\\n__label__1 OK review of ice cream cookbook: After reading all the reviews of this Ben and Jerry\\'s ice cream recipe book, I ordered it. I do not think it contains what I was looking forward to with the recipes contained therein., and would not order it again knowing its contents. I found that surfing the internet gave me the recipes I wanted - for example pistachio ice cream, peanut butter cup ice cream, etc.\\n__label__2 Pyramid RPR425 4 Gauge Power Wire: My grandson used this wire to connect his speaker system up in his \"new\" car. I can assure you that the wiring works, I hear that radio thumping all the time:). Thus far, he hasn\\'t had any problems, i.e. wire burning or melting.\\n__label__1 not real 4 gauge: this wire is not true 4 gauge. i would not recomend this for anything other than speaker wire\\n__label__1 Not what I was looking for: I was looking more for crossword puzzles, there are very few of those in here. It\\'s fine if you\\'re looking for other kinds of puzzles.\\n__label__2 Funny, witty, and full of surprises!: I enjoy good movies so I found this book to be the perfect summer read. It\\'s funny, and witty, and full of surprises about Nick and his Hollywood associates. I had no idea the actor was so dedicated -- and so much fun to be around!\\n__label__2 Some Important Product Details: Playboy\\'s Playmate of the MonthRaquel Gibson photographed by Stephen Wayda and Arny FreytagInterviewJamie Foxx by Michael FlemingFeaturesAfter The Party With Jamie Foxx: A Brash Playboy InterviewIn Bed With The Girls Next Door: E!\\'s Hot New ShowSpecial Photo Feature: Dancing With The Stars\\' Kelly MonacoPlus: Winter Coats, Harvey Pekar, An NFL TragedyModelBridget Marquardt, Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson (covergirl - nude inside) photographed by Arny Freytag\\n__label__1 Not received yet: I\\'ve not received it and its taking long time than expected.Since I\\'ve not received it, I can\\'t say whether its good or not.\\n__label__1 Auto Shut Off does not work: The iron automatically shut off four times while I was ironing one shirt. The instructions say that the iron shuts off after seven minutes but it\\'s more like every thirty seconds (very annoying!). The iron does not produce much steam. Also, the headlight is very difficult to turn off an off and on.\\n__label__1 Poor: Having used Mavis Beacon 8 long ago I wanted a refresher... This program is really not well designed--the biggest problem is each exercise only features a line or two of the appropriate new symbols/keys and then you are typing all the letters you know--sometimes even ones you haven\\'t been taught yet--so it\\'s difficult to solidify the finger positioning of new keys and gets confusing. Really not well thought out. There are enough advanced features that an experienced typist can increase their speed or a child COULD learn on it... but MB is so much better. Someone claiming to go from 20 to 54 wpm in a week is either an experienced typist that was rusty or lying (then 103 wpm. Sure).\\n__label__1 Company does not stand behind product: This is the second Rip off product that I have owned and this one must be a dud. I would expect someone to help me but I get no help. Beware.\\n__label__1 A waste of time and money: If you are considering purchasing this thing to make copies of commercially made VHS tapes to DVD, don\\'t waste your time or your money because it is essentially useless for that purpose, the resulting copies are horrible, grainy, and with jittery lines in the picture, etc. Some people say this thing will remove the Macrovision protection which is responsible for the wavy lines and such, but forget it, it will not, at least not to any kind of acceptable degree. As far as I know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own, for your own personal use under the \"fair use\" provision, just as you can make an archival copy of computer software, as long as it is for your own use, and not to sell etc. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to DVD although I have not tried that yet.\\n__label__2 beautiful: This is slow beautiful music. NOT ambient and NOT new age and NOT sappy (in my opinion), just simply beautiful. Think Mogwai, Lanterna, or Dif Juz, but better. There are low volume vocals, but mostly instrumental. Some of the most perfect peaceful music. The song \"The Sort of Juice I\\'m Used To\" is by far the best. Don\\'t let the interesting song titles fool you, this is a must have.\\n__label__2 Since Otar Left: This touching film speaks to the irrational ties of familial loyalty that even a lifetime of hurt won\\'t extinguish. With warmth and subtlety, it details how the younger generation of women protect the health and well-being of the eldest through the kindest of deceptions. Though consumed by long-simmering resentment over Eka\\'s favoritism toward her only son, Marina still makes an unselfish choice to shield Eka from hurt .\"Otar\" is a life-affirming gem, with all three actresses superb in the central roles, particularly Gorintin, who broke my heart as Eka.\\n__label__2 Polyethnic Slamgrass: Salmon\\'s best effort to date! Guest appearances by Waylon Jennings, Taj Mahal, Bela Fleck, and J.B. make this a very entertaining and memorable album. -jg\\n__label__2 Good thoughts but poorly written: This book has many good thoughts and insights but is poorly written. A good editor would have helped this author immensely. It has bad syntax and sentence structure and was a frustrating and laborious read. I hope and pray that Mr. Rogers publishes another volume of this. He has wonderful insight which, unfortunately, becomes diminished by the lack of time that was spent on editing.\\n__label__2 Mexican House Building How-To in story format...sort of: This is a great story of how an American couple built their Mexican dream house in Sayulita, Mexico near Puerto Vallarta. While it\\'s not a Mexican house building how-to, it does give you an idea of what you\\'ll have to go through to build an authentic Mexican house on your own. Hopefully, you\\'ll have a good experience as this couple did and not like the one described inGod and Mr. Gomez.\\n__label__2 They\\'re Back!: Ye Gads! I\\'m 44, and first read this book in the 6th grade. Ever since my boys were born (they are now 14 and 11), I\\'ve been searching bookstores for \"The Three Investigators\" and always told they were out of print. Finally, my kids have the chance to read something exciting that demonstrates the power of logic and critical examination to solve a problem. Everything winds up having a logical, real-world explanation; none of this \"x-file\" mystery junk that has no bearing on reality. And done by characters that are believable and all children can relate to! I re-read this book numerous times in my childhood, and hope my children will enjoy it as much as I did. Long live Jupe, Pete and Bob and Tunnel Two!\\n__label__1 Not the right ink to go with the printer I purchased: I purchased an Epson Stylus 1400 phot printer, and this ink was featured on the same page to \"buy together\". However, this is not the correct ink for the printer and should not have been featured to buy together. It\\'s most likely good ink, it\\'s just not compatible with the Epson Stylus 1400.\\n__label__2 It\\'s an Ink Cartridge: I installed this cartridge in my printer as soon as it arrived, since I was completely out of black ink. Then I ran a couple of test prints to check the alignment and nozzles, and all was perfect. So what can I say? It\\'s an ink cartridge, and it works as well as expected.\\n__label__1 doubtful it is a new Epson cartridge: I read a lot of reviews and a lot of them said only buy your ink from Epson. I couldn\\'t resist the price and bought off Amazon. This black cartridge took about 20 minutes of convincing, reinstalling, head cleaning, repeat, etc before it would print black. I also bought a 5-pack of colors because the package looked authentic. Duh. They weren\\'t in a package when they arrived. They were made in Mexico. They may be former Epson cartridges that have been refilled. I haven\\'t tried them yet. As a consolation prize, they sent me a black cartridge along with my 5 colors. ?? Lesson learned. After this, I will *only buy ink for Epson printers from Epson*.\\n__label__2 It works the first time around: I have heard a lot of people say how the printer did not recognize the ink cartridges and I was a little worried; however, I had no problem with the printer or the cartridges. It worked fine and I am very pleased with the printer and the cartridges.\\n__label__1 Yeah, I have to agree. . .: . . this book is so terribly written and edited that it was impossible to begin to tackle Flash MX with it, I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t check Amazon first. By the first chapter I knew this book was going to be useless; three pages into Chapter One she begins a segment called, \"Get a Flash File Up On The Web\". Now, why would you concern yourself with this step, in the beginning of the first chapter of a book on how to use Flash? That\\'s the way the whole book goes. A disaster.\\n__label__1 Only oatmeal- no granola.: This product is only sweetened oatmeal with varying amounts of blueberries, but there is absolutely NO GRANOLA in any of the the 4 boxes I\\'ve eaten so far. So when the box says Granola, read oatmeal and six dried blueberries. It tastes fine for what it is, just know that it is not granola (like the box says it is).\\n__label__2 If you are a true BT Fan, You\\'ll love this.: What more can I really say?What\\'s nice about this one is that its all John. Not that the rest of BT pulls him down or anything. Its just nice to see a different side of John. The music resembles Blues Traveler but it is not the same so don\\'t expect that if you\\'re buying this CD.This peaceful sound is a must have for your collection.\\n__label__2 Really Good: When I bought this video, I was not sure if would be affordable. But, when I watched, I really enjoy it. Good music, good harmony, good jokes, I love GVB and I like Signature Sound. But when I watched Together, it was if Gaither joined the best of GVB with the best of SS. Surely recommended!\\n__label__1 Wonderful Magic Combination...: This is a wonderful DVD put out by Bill Gaither featuring the Gaither Vocal Band and Ernie Haase and Signature Sound. They are magical together. There is a unique blend of all their voices that is so great. The choice of songs on this DVD was spectacular, but I think the greatest one, if I had to pick just one, was \"Sitting At the Feet of Jesus.\" I have many of the Bill Gaither VHS tapes and DVD\\'s and although I don\\'t have some of the older ones, I have not heard this particular song sung on any of them before. It has always been one of my very favorites. But this pairing of the two groups was nothing but inspirational on Bill\\'s part to do this.\\n__label__1 Totally Dissatisfied: The speaker is very bad, the music, not good.The actual routine goes too fast.How do they expect begginers to follow this routine?\\n__label__2 If your friends don\\'t get it, they\\'re not worthy of you: My parents used to play this at their cocktail parties to see who was paying attention. If attendees didn\\'t catch the whimsy, they were deemed dense. If they sang along in the same cadence and/or pitch they were deemed drunk enough and were served no more but applauded for their efforts.This is actually a product of two very talented people who probably had a struggle with singing and playing terribly.I have been looking for LPs of this for 30 yrs at flea markets, garage sales, etc.....it is here at Amazon that I found it. I am extremely gratified. It has helped me separate the chaff from the wheat in the \"friend\" department!!!!\\n__label__2 The voice of an angel: It is wonderful to hear angelic music like this. Nobody can do a song like Darlene Edwards. Her husband Jonathan is equally talented on the piano. My favorite time to listen to this is either after a stressful time at work any time I want to relax. Darlene has the voice of an angel, what kind of angel you decide.\\n__label__2 The Shooter: The perfomance by Randy Travis and Michael Dutikoff were very understated. They both did a great job. I was able to work on this movie and Randy Travis actually shoots me. The opening scene is the only thing that makes this an R rated movie. Otherwise it is great! If you are going to watch it with the kids, start it after the whipping scene or have it cued up so they don\\'t have to see it.\\n__label__2 Wiggles fan: Our daughter is a big Wiggles fan and really enjoys watching this, whether at home or in our vehicle. We find ourselves singing and dancing to the tunes also. It does have a few songs in Spanish. Worth the purchase if your child is a fan.\\n__label__2 Handy to keep in the car.: The factory charger cord finally crapped out, and this one fits the cigarette lighter snugly without slipping out. It does what It\\'s supposed to.\\n__label__1 somewhat tiresome: The book started out interesting, but about half way through, it got tiresome. The villians were predictable and the plot far to slow.At 70 pages from the end...just didn\\'t care anymore. Those last few pages were really hard to get through, yet should have been the best part of the book. Sorry just can\\'t recommend this one.\\n__label__2 How musical performances interact with local social systems: Gregory Barz\\'s MUSIC IN EAST AFRICA introduces readers to the historical and modern musical performances unique to East Africa.Chapters in his MUSIC IN EAST AFRICA select individual musicians working in both traditional and contemporary fusions of sounds.Add eyewitness accounts of performances and descriptions of how musical performances interact with local social systems and you have a blend of music theory and anthropology unique to this series.\\n__label__1 Barely functional anymore: Years ago these used to be good. Now it\\'s hard to find one that works properly, you have to get a box of 100 and hope some of them will work well. Why is this? It\\'s become a throw-away society, quality is on the decline. Speedball probably thinks that few will notice the reduction in quality (except for the handful of professionals who are experts on their materials), so why not cut some corners and make more profits?I\\'ve been using drawing/inking art supplies for 22 years professionally and I have a hard time getting these to do their job now. Many of my other pro friends say the same thing. I\\'ve switched to Deleter\\'s Comic Pen 240, from Japan, and it works as it should.\\n__label__1 Highly Disappointed: Fist of all, I didn\\'t receive the Flea Zapper shown in the picture(even though that is the one I ordered. I sent a e-mail to the company but got no reply. The 2nd problem is the fact that it DOESN\\'T WORK. It does not \"zap\" the fleas as stated. The teeth on the comb are too close together so the cats hair doesn\\'t go through them. I ran it over fleas on the cat\\'s belly where there is very little hair....same results...NOTHING HAPPENED! I am very disappointed with this product and want my money back!\\n__label__2 Different Battles is a fascinating read.: Different Battles is a truly unusual book. It\\'s a meticulously researched, vividly imagined historical study. But it\\'s also a moving personal memoir--all the more powerful for being understated. On top of all that, it\\'s a fascinating read.The author grew up in Vero Beach, Florida during World War II when German subs were a greater threat along the U.S. East coast than most people realized. The boy\\'s father, Kit Johnson, uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the Germans. He later fights a very \"different battle\" with Alzheimer\\'s. Peter Cremer, the charismatic and somewhat enigmatic Commander of a German U-boat, captures the reader\\'s imagination. But as we gradually come to realize, the author\\'s father is the real hero of the book.\\n__label__2 Diary of St. Faustina: St. Faustina\\'s diary is absolutely beautiful. As I have been reading, I have fallen in love with St. Faustina and feel a very strong connection with her. Even as she suffered and struggled, she always stayed focused on Christ and lived her life beautifully for Him. I encourage you to read this book and just enjoy the beauty of how much God loves us.\\n__label__2 Simply Divine: This book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with Christ. It\\'s an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God\\'s Divine Mercy and God\\'s desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God\\'s mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy. Reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read.\\n__label__1 Comercial: This magazine has been most of time full of not well written article. Too much advertise inside and very repetitive. It needs more creativity and embracement of ahimsa towards the reders. I mean, I can read an article without being attacked by on the hundreds of commercials inside.Which becomes very distractive.I think it should be free at every yoga studio entrance or a very small fee to be delivered at your house.\\n__label__1 Will Review It If It Ever Arrives: Ordered it and paid for it in full, (two-year subscription) on January 6 as a gift for my wife. It is almost June and it\\'s no deal from Deal Universe.\\n__label__1 to much on religion: i gave this a a gift to a chick friend of mine and she said this mag takes yoga to much as a religion than a workout. I told her well yeah thats what it is... what did you expect?\\n__label__1 Too female-oriented: Y j used to be more geared to everyone. Now it has a guy\\'s picture on the cover only once in 8 years!\\n__label__2 War With Grandpa: I like this book because it is funny. It\\'s about a boy who had to give up his room for his grandpa. They started a war. Grandpa had problems with his leg but he succeded on the war. Peter has a little sister named Jenny and a mom and dad. Whenever Peter does something to his grandpa he gets back. And one time grandpa took Peter fishing. If you want to know more read it.\\n__label__2 an awsome book: War With Grandpa is an awsome book. It is about Peter Stocks and his grandpa go to war when grandpa take his room .You would like it if you like funny books. My favirot partis when granpa did his last move.\\n__label__1 The War With Grandpa: I rate this book 2.5 because I think that the author shouldn\\'t have made the ending the way it ended. The book is about a boy named Peter. He loves his room. When he hears the news that his grandpa is coming he is happy, but when he looks into it he finds out that grandpa is taking his room... he starts a war. I would recommend this book if you do not like your grandpa (it might give you some ideas!). Age-wise, I would say this is for kids ages 8-10 years old. It\\'s a comedy.~N64 NDS\\n__label__2 Grandpa\\'s War: I liked this book because it has a war. Wars are not good but in this book,they learn their lesson. By passing notes to each other, they ended the war. I would recommend this book.Review by Koresha\\n__label__2 warwith grandpa: I think the storey was grat! because peter chris to get his room back and dose he secseed. find out if you read this grat book!\\n__label__1 WarWithGrandpa: I dont like this book very much becaus it dident have enoughexcitment.And the words are easy to read.One part of the storyI liked was when they caught a whole bunch of flounder.\\n__label__2 The War with Grandpa: I think this was a great book. My favorite part is when Peter stole Grandpa\\'s false teeth. My least favorite part is when grandpa pull\\'s all those dirty tricks on Peter. All together I think you will like this book.\\n__label__2 Tuck Triumphant: When Helen\\'s family decides to adopt a child, they get a Korean boy named Chok Do Choy. When they pick him up at the airport, they find out a horrible secret. Read the book to find out!The book is well written and the author makes you want to read on. Theodore Taylor is a very colorful writer. He uses lots of literary devices and he makes me feel like I\\'m right in the story.I would recommend this book to people who like suspense, tragedy, and humor.\\n__label__1 Prefer his Spanish music: I love Marc Anthony, love his voice, love his songs, but not crazy about this CD. I just don\\'t like his English music so much. I knew two of the songs on this CD and didn\\'t mind listening to them, but wasn\\'t crazy enough to love all the songs or the CD. It\\'s just not me. I think Marc Anthony is better and more emotional in Spanish than in English.\\n__label__1 Ay Bendito!: Ay Bendito! que te paso mi\\'jo? El mejor de los artistas con esas cosas! (you know better.... you, all, know what I mean!) y no es porque no me guste la salsa en ingles (recordemos a Tito Nieves). Enough!.\\n__label__2 214 Reviews..Can We Talk? He Got You..Yes \\'Marc Anthony\\': He sure got me..Touch Me, Touch Me...This Man is Like \\'The Best\\', Yes Most Definitely. Have you ever Had Your Soul Touched...He can Do That. Oh my goodness. \\'\\'My Baby You\\'\\' you will love this song. \\'My Baby You Are The Reason I Can Fly\\'. Yes he will take you to the depths of your soul and then lift you to \\'The Stars.\\' Saw him on Michael Jackson\\'s 30th singing \\'She\\'s Out of My Life\\' and I\\'m sure the whole world went to buy his CD the very next day. I truly feel all the songs on this CD, you will die for. You Can Feel His Passion Like Wow...You Just Gotta get this CD. Words just cannot explain how Great This Man is. We need his kind of music to stimulate the senses and feel the Passion. And we all Love Passion. And Very Romantic..all ages would love this CD. ,.)Sincerely PrincessColleen xxO\\n__label__1 Good Singer/Bad Songs: I love, love, love, love Marc Anthony; he is one of my favorite Latino singers, and I have followed him from the beginning of his career. If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other \"latin craze\" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now \"the rage\" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released. In other countries, the music scene is much more international...\\n__label__2 El CD MAS BUENO DE MARC ANTHONY!!!: Este Cd de MArc Anthony es el mas bueno ke a sakado!! Tiene todo, salsa, pop, y romantica!!! Las canciones estan super, buenisimas y tienen mucho sentimiento!! Se lo recomiendo a todos los ke le guste la muica romantica!!!!!\\n__label__2 You Can Sing!!!: I\\'m sorry, move over Ricky Martin and Enrique. Marc has real talent. He can actually sing. that\\'s something rare in music today. He tore up My Baby You, No Me Ames and I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You. Go Marc!!!!You have skills boyee!!\\n__label__2 Riding The Waves: Marc Anthony has hopped on a shiny pop music train with his self-titled English debut. While longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they\\'ve always known him for, there\\'s still plenty of continuity in the fact that he\\'s as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic.Then again, Marc Anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots, so would-be critics should be warned--he wont be tied down. The single I Need to Know, with its pulsing salsa horns and piano, was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the Latin floodgate opened by Ricky Martin (Anthony used to sing back up to Menudo)and others.Thats Okay delves a bit deeper into the clave, while the plaintive How Could I combines the fluid fire of Spanish guitar with soft, slow-jam programming. A sweet pop nugget, You Sang to Me offers soaring waves of keyboard as Anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency.Sexy, salsa king rides the crossover wave.\\n__label__1 Not so wonderful: I thought this would be wonderful to keep the wipes warm so as not to shock the bottom of my son at diaper changes. I was mistaken however. The wipes we either dry or soaking wet and never really that warm. Not worth your money if you ask me.\\n__label__1 mine broke!!!: I bought 2 of these, one for upstairs, and one for downstairs in my home. The top lid broke on both of them. I would not recommend this product. Look for one a little more sturdy than this!!!!\\n__label__2 no more 3am screaming from cold wipes: my daughter loves the warm wipes and my husband and i love that we don\\'t have to listen to her scream when a cold wipes touches her. especially at 3 am. They can dry out a little but the directions tell you to add a little water.\\n__label__1 Mine quit retracting after the thrid use.: This thing is of mediocre quality at best. Mine quit retracting within the first week of using it.\\n__label__2 Good everyday cage cleaner: Poop-off works well for everyday cage cleaning, and can be used on almost everything-- perches, cage bars and grate, and even on the walls next to the cage. Dried, hardened parrot droppings clean up easier if the product is sprayed on and left to sit for a few seconds. Helps make cleanups faster and easier.\\n__label__2 Ranma 1/2: The fifth book of Rumiko Takahashi\\'s Ranma 1/2 continues the on going plot of Ranma, a boy who can change into a girl using cold water. Of course, this brings up all sorts of strange and funny situations! The fifth volume is no different! It is still is some of the best and most classic of Takahashi\\'s work. It\\'s very funny and outragious. If love Ranma 1/2 or your just an Anime fan, this book would be great to add to your collection!\\n__label__2 My daughter loves it: Yes, the boy doll can only really fit into the lifeguard or doctor, but my 4 year old daughter puts the doctor or lifeguard outfits on the girls too. They\\'re just a little loose ... but she doesn\\'t even notice. However, she is a little sad that the boy can\\'t wear any of the other clothes, but I don\\'t think she\\'s lost sleep over it (since the boy doll is a little larger than the girl dolls). She\\'s so obsessed about being a doctor one day, that she\\'s thrilled she gets to dress them up in a doctor outfit. She loves it.\\n__label__2 Murder can Singe your Old Flame: This is a great book and fits well into the series. I love Desiree, who is very down to earth and real.\\n__label__1 **WORST**SOUND**EVER**: I could have produced a better quality sound back in the day with a $70.00 Pioneer cassette deck. Actually, I did record and produce better sounding material around the same time as these recordings with a 1st generation cassette deck. Potential buyers should notice there is no way to sample the selections. Now I know why.Buyers beware of this product. Whether this is a defective product or unlistenable c**p; someone should be held accountable for this out and out ripoff.\\n__label__2 the movies are: INCLUDES FIVE DIGITALLY REMASTERED, FULL LENGTH FEATURE FILMS: SWAMP WOMEN, WOMEN IN CAGES, THE BIG BUST OUT, AND THE HOT BOX......BONUS MOVIE: HIGH SCHOOL BIG SHOT\\n__label__1 Shipping was fantastic, but quality of product was VERY disappointing: Purchased item expecting it to be of same quality as my other Laguiole knives. Not even close.So very disappointed with the knives. If you\\'ve ever had the pleasure of owning \"the real McCoy\"you\\'d know the difference in a heartbeat. I thought they\\'d make a nice addition for \"everyday\" toour other knives. So..... very sorry I wasted my hard earned money on this \"cheap\" imitation!\\n__label__2 A film about patriotic duty vs. love: Based on a famous Thai novel by Tommayanti, Sunset At Chaopraya (aka Khu Gam) has been made into a multilingual film.Set in Thailand during WWII; it\\'s a story about Kobori, a Japanese soldier who unquestioningly takes command of an army base in a region called Thonburi as instructed by his superiors, but finds himself emotionally struggling with his new role and his sense of duty, as well as his deep attraction for a Thai woman named, Angsumalin.Overall, a pretty good film for those who like emotional rollercoasters. Initially, the beginning is slow, but as it progresses, you want to know how it turns out. Kind of reminds you of a certain Jane Austen story, but to mention the name would spoil the film.\\n__label__2 Impressed Clarinet Student: I recently played the Weber Concerto 1 in a competition and bought the recording to help me with it. Weber is an incredible composer and I have found this CD to be inspiring and entertaining! It\\'s a great set.\\n__label__1 This book is insane: The book has a big problem in formualing how to go about doing different accounting calcuations. The language is not clear and the diagrams are useless because there is no references as how the calculation came to be. Most of the time it starts on six pages back and if you do not read very carefully, you will miss the whole idea. Had this book for two quarters in college and hated it. All of the students that were in my classes came to the agreement that the authors could not agree and that the exericses were a disaster as well.If you buy this book and totally understand it Kudos.\\n__label__1 Book sucks: This book is gayest thing ever. I have to google every thing in the book to get it properly. The author must be a virgin\\n__label__2 Review of Getting Your Next Job: This book demonstrates a practical, straightforward approach to job hunting. It\\'s particularly useful to those facing unemployment or simply contemplating a career change. The section which covers C.V.s is particulary strong.Despite there being a large number of books which cover similar topics, I believe this book approaches the subject in a new nd refreshing way.\\n__label__2 Is helping me!: I read this book as a companion to her \"Messies Manual\" book. I find that they fit beautifully together. I needed to understand that I\\'m not just a lazy slob- or a hopeless failure at making a home. I have a personality that is shared by many other wonderful women. Learning to work with and not against myself has given me help and HOPE.I agree- if you are looking for a how to organize your home- this won\\'t meet your needs. If you have tried and failed at homemaking and need to figure yourself and your needs out- this is a great place to come.I feel it needs the companionship of \"The Messies Manual\" to be complete.I\\'d buy and read it first.\\n__label__2 A dream of a book: The extraordinary care that was taken by the publisher in the production and design of this book goes beyond beauty. The weight, proportions, paper and typography are something like the experience of the original, or at least, of what the experience of reading was in the time of Colonna. This all helps illuminate the hallucinatory, allegorical text, and for this reader, I felt as if I was inhaling some kind of ether. What breathtaking insight this book provides into the sensibility and mileu of the Renaissance.\\n__label__1 Poorly written, not informative: This book was a real disappointment. I do not recommend it to anyone interested in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt. There are much better books on the subject available:The Pueblo Revolt : The Secret Rebellion That Drove the Spaniards Out of the Southwest,The Pueblo Revolt (Bison Book), andPo\\'pay: Leader of the First American Revolution.Check out the above titles and skip this one.\\n__label__1 It\\'s like a CD that hasn\\'t finished completion: Like in \"Departure\": \\'Here it comes, bad\\' All R.E.M. songs are solid unities of pure listening enjoyment and I am a very big R.E.M.-fan. But this is a R.E.M. CD not made by R.E.M. And that\\'s what is wrong. Even as only-instrumental music, it isn\\'t as good as the originals. But I guess that in the end, it\\'s nice to hear the nice tunes of these classic songs. But it\\'s lacking Stipe and Mills beautiful voices, Buck\\'s superb guitar technique\\'s and Berry\\'s drums. Only for die-hard R.E.M.-fans who want everything that\\'s R.E.M.-related. Maybe it can be used in the elevator of the R.E.M.-clubhouse.\\n__label__2 Finally!: Finally, a book about magic from someone other than the usual suspects, saying something other than the usual. My only complaint is that the book is sometimes difficult to read because I find myself stopping after individual essays to go for long walks and digest. Some essays, I find myself stopping after almost every sentence to think about what I\\'ve just read. I particularly like Louv\\'s writing and ideas; there\\'s a deep-down freshness to his writing and \"oh gosh!\" enthusiasm that I can\\'t stop loving.\\n__label__2 rock\\'n\\'surf: Raw, energic, punk as well as smooth, relaxed, surf , both sides of this record are excellent, both made me happy that rock music is still alive. So if you like rock or surf or simply rock\\'n\\'surf instumental music, don\\'t miss this one.\\n__label__2 Wonderfully relaxing and highly enjoyable: There are 14 lovely tracks on this CD. Most are simply grand flute music by numerous 1st American artists. Some include chants that seem to stay with you throughout the day. It\\'s great to listen to, read inspiring books by, and meditate to. Highly recommended, especially for those enamored with flute music.\\n__label__2 kinda compelling...: this cd takes singer-songwriters work to slightly somewhere else.part of the time it sounds like chris isaak singing unknown tim buckley songs.. the other songs veer totally into pj harvey territory. by the end he is combining the two approaches. kinda compelling. and someone to watch..david garza fans might like this too\\n__label__2 Schubert: Goethe-Lieder / Fischer-Dieskau, Demus, Moore: Songs of a legendary composer and lyricist by one of the best singers ever. Definitely worth hearing. Also received quickly and in fine condition, which is typical for Amazon.\\n__label__2 Great Relaxing CD: I picked this CD up in a small record shop while on vacation in Santa Fe, New Mexico 5 years ago. The music is wonderful. Very peaceful and relaxing. Nice pan flute. I hope this group continues to make more CDs. I will get their other CD titled \"Turquoise Visions\".\\n__label__2 Wonderful wish maybe it could happen book: Just a beautiful book, not only in appearance but in content. Open up this book on a January day in the dead of winter and dream, dream, dream. Of course, as the author states dreaming is the beginning. It opens up all the possibilities and options for one\\'s own retreat. I enjoyed it immensely as I\\'m sure you will. Live life to it\\'s fullest.\\n__label__2 Quality Product, quick delivery!: I Ordered the VW02-AUX a week ago and I just received it, the install was quick and harmless (2007 VW GTI) It took me about 20 minutes to have everything completed. The sound quality that you get from the unit is flawless, I have it hooked up to my Android phone and its just like listening to my CD\\'s. Quality Product, quick delivery!\\n__label__1 Turrible: This product seemed like a good idea, was doing half swings indoors at first, then finally took it outside and did a full swing, the dang thing broke off and flew and hit my buddys headlight, like the title says...turrible\\n__label__2 Socially relevant AND street: I was really feeling his wordplay on Stay Troop...Nowadays rappers can\\'t rap but dude is solid.\\n__label__2 Awesome track!: I love this track! And the darda cars go so super fast! The only thing is you have to hold down the track. I\\'m going to mount it on a piece of plywood.\\n__label__1 Stupid!: Waste of money. Fill a spray bottle with water, add a squirt of dishwashing liquid and a teaspoon or two of liquid laundry detergent that contains ENZYMES...Trust me, Cheap and it works just as well. buy your bird a toy with the money you save!\\n__label__2 A Must for Bird Owners: This product makes husbandry easier and quicker. I have been using it for, geez, probably 10 years or so and can\\'t say enough about it. It\\'s pleasant smelling, quick acting, non-toxic and makes clean up a breeze. You need this product if you have a caged bird!\\n__label__2 Tree frogs: Delightful little board book that shows tree frogs up close and personal! Excellent photography.\\n__label__2 destroys stereotypes of medieval peasants: This book does a great job of getting straight to the peasants themselves and depicting their lives as much as possible instead of lumping them together as all equally miserable, brutish, callous, etc.\\n__label__2 A Good Solid Romance: Who said that boys can\\'t like a happy ending romance??? Because I really enjoyed this book although I thought that some of the characters were a little extreme. Anyway I REALLY like this manga!!! But I can\\'t show it to my guy-friends...\\n__label__1 Awful!!!: Thank goodness I rented this movie before actually buying it. It wasn\\'t even funny at all. I am greatly disappointed and thought it was going to be good! The creators really missed a lot of opportunities to make a fantastic movie!\\n__label__2 figured it would suck but it didn\\'t!: after seeing the trailers on tv for this (quite a while ago!) I figured it would be a cheesy movie with a few one liners - boy was I wrong! it surprised me from the beginning and I can still laugh while thinking of a few parts of it now! I don\\'t even like Cameron Diaz but in this she does GREAT!not one for kids though! I still won\\'t let mine watch but I\\'m strict like that.\\n__label__1 terrible.: 1st off, Cameron Diaz was grossly miscast in this role. There were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better (how does she keep getting job after job after job?? She\\'s an AWFUL actress - at best).Now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone. But these \"jokes\" were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny. This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can\\'t dish out zero stars. Avoid at all costs.\\n__label__1 BAD MOVIE: I don\\'t know how Cameron Diaz EVER agreed to do this crap! The writing is horrible and the acting is worse!\\n__label__2 Bad Teacher DVD: Purchased as a gift for an adult. Fun movie. Shipped fast. Arrived in perfect condition. Great price. Didn\\'t have to fight the crowds in the stores.\\n__label__1 2 Minute trailer far better than the entire film!: I had been wanting to see this movie since I saw the previews - since seeing it, I could have just as well stuck with the previews. It was as if someone filmed short clips and stuck them together - there were many parts of the film that did not transition very well, and there was very little chemistry between the actors in the movie. To keep this short, I will not be watching this movie again.\\n__label__1 Bad Teacher = Bad Movie: I just finished watching this really bad movie and thought I\\'d jump over to Amazon and see what others thought of it. Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can\\'t believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There\\'s the good part of Hollywood, and then there\\'s this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that\\'s what it\\'s worth. Maybe not even that much. What\\'s next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn\\'t be surprised.\\n__label__2 surprisingly funny: Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I\\'ve seen all year. Don\\'t take it seriously and you\\'ll love it!\\n__label__2 A pleasant surprise.: A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fiancé\\' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.\\n__label__1 The reviews are correct; this movie stinks: 1. This is one of those movies where you think, wonder, perhaps hope that all of the negative review are wrong... because there are well know actors in this film. But this film proves again and again that famous actors + lousy writing = lousy movie.2. Please save yourself some time and money, pass on this complete dud.\\n__label__1 \"Bad\" is accurate for this stinker: This is easily one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen. Thankfully I am just out the cost for rental and didn\\'t buy the DVD or see it in the theater. Rather than come up with any remotely funny dialogue, the writers just pile on f-bombs, or worse. The only reason I watched to the end was to see how much worse it could continue to get. The great Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal are totally wasted. The gorg Cameron Diaz should fire her agent. Do yourself a favor and run away from this humorless turd.\\n__label__1 Bad? More like terrible...: There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren\\'t good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong). There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher. I couldn\\'t tell if Justin T\\'s character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting. There were zero likeable characters and no character development. From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone. Did something happen to her as a child? A little background would be nice. Overall, pointless.\\n__label__1 bad teacher: BAD is right!!! After the first half hour had to turn it off. Life is way to short. I wouldn\\'t waste your money on buying it. Rent it first if at all.\\n__label__1 Should be rated X: First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don\\'t. I don\\'t believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it\\'s still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn\\'t necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.\\n__label__1 Disappointing: I couldn\\'t muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page 41. I found it difficult to relate to, sympathize with, or even respect the characters. They were intolerable, existing only to drive the plot. The book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity, but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic, gender, racial, economic, generational, and, especially, the individual divide.The characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior, manner, and thought. A stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book.\\n__label__1 Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy: I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she\\'s lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope.\\n__label__2 Good book: Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn\\'t a \"downer.\"Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for \"belonging\" as is almost everybody else in the book.You\\'ll enjoy this book, It\\'s not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion.\\n__label__1 Boring: I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It\\'s my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn\\'t connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears.\\n__label__1 Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book: I\\'ve read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven\\'t finished it yet) isn\\'t very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I\\'m just going to have to set aside a few hours and \"get it out of the way\" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain\\'t moving along.\\n__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn\\'t feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.\\n__label__2 Romance & Politics: The Devil\\'s Paw, a novel of espionage and intrigue during World War I, is very dated in light of subsequent historical events, but it is facinating nonetheless. There is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters, but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of England at that time. Julian Orden, son of a British aristocrat and vocal espouser of the Socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets Catherine, a young woman of mixed antecedents--British and Russian. In her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before. These two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of Germany and England to force a premature end to World War I. I enjoyed this book, but unless you are interested in the philosophy of British politics and the position of Socialism in that era, I would suggest another choice.\\n__label__1 Does not work as advertised: Got this flash to work with Nikon\\'s CLS as a remote unit. Before purchase I called Sigma to ask if it would do this. Was assured that yes it would.Does NOT work as advertised or as Sigma tech support assured me it would. I run 5 SB-800s and two SB-600s so I know how to use the system.Save your self time and money and buy a true Nikon unit.\\n__label__2 Excellent Resource: This was a required text for one of my classes in my credential program and I ended up using it throughout my entire credential program. It has a very detailed perspective on teaching to a diverse classroom and gives some excellent pointers on the developmental levels of different aged students. I found the concepts and ideas to be beneficial, comprehensive, and ideal. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge and insights into the diverse classroom.\\n__label__1 Biased writer: This book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification. I noticed that the author works at my university so I\\'m not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a \"guide on the side\". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn\\'t good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt. Don\\'t become another victim of teacher certification indoctrination like this author is.\\n__label__2 Ask The Teacher: I bought this book for my teaching/credential program. I found it very interesting and have used it as a reference for all my classes. Mark Ryan provides helpful information for teaching and provides different strategies to use in the diverse classroom. The book is straighforward and versatile. It presents concise and positive advice about teaching and learning. A \"must have\" book for students and teachers to keep in their library!\\n__label__2 INFORMATIVE: This book blows What to Expect When You\\'re Expecting away! It is very informative and includes a 3 page journal for each month so you can keep track of how you feel, etc. I highly recommend this book. Do not waste your money on What to Expect.... The Pregnancy Book by the Dr. Sears is also wonderful.\\n__label__2 Best Progressive Trance Mix of the 90\\'s: The songs on this CD, more than any other, defined the evolution of the west coast trance and techno scene in the late 1990\\'s. His mixtape \"Contact\" is even better. A California desert rave is being delivered to your CD player. Enjoy!\\n__label__1 If I could give this book 0 stars I would!!!: I knew it would be bad from the moment I saw it because, WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT TO ESAPE FROM WITCHCRAFT? ... Wicca is a great religon and It is not about worshiping the devil. Witches worship God. ... ... Dont waste your money. ...\\n__label__2 Very educational: If you enjoy weather prediction, this is a fantastic book from a premier authority. The only problem, the book we received was 1 edition old. It\\'s still a good book.\\n__label__2 I was definately Utterly Confused: This book is written by my current teacher. He has done a fantastic job of highlighting and condensing the most essential information that is critical for each chapter. Also some of the information contained in the testing area of the book is actually on his tests that are provided through McGraw Hill Connect.\\n__label__1 I didn\\'t love it.: This story of Grace O\\'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn\\'t bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce\\'s fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce\\'s use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the \"romance\" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it.\\n__label__2 Best knife ever!!!!!!: A nice, hefty feel, a big blade - quality USA craftmanship - and beautiful materials. I love it so much, I immediately bought more. This is truly an heirloom item. You won\\'t be disappointed!!!\\n__label__1 Disappointing: I bought this CD based on all the positive reviews. I found it to be insipid, weak and flat. It only contains one cut worth playing more than once (I miss you madly). Very much background or elevator muzak. I was hoping to find something new and fresh. Like another comment stated, just a watered down Earl Klugh wannabee. Save your money for Earl.\\n__label__2 Soothing Guitar: My first introduction to Lawrence Barris came after hearing \"Loveland\" from this cd a few years back. I own both of Lawrence\\'s cds and I think this one is far better than his Love on Me cd. All the songs feature that soft and soothing guitar accented by keyboards and percussion. My favorite is still \"Loveland\", but other good songs include \"Our Midnight Dance\", \"Sometime, Somewhere\" and \"Afternoon Samba\". This cd is definitely worth checking out.\\n__label__1 You need training or just be honest.: I ordered this item and received 3 different sizes of baking dishes instead of this one. I returned them with an explaination, in the box, and again received the same 3 baking dishes. I Talked with the Amazon people, and they said that it was a miss write on the description, and that they were fixing it as we were talking. They credited my account. A week later I checked for the Item I wanted and there it was, no different than when I first ordered it. I really wanted this item and it seems that they can\\'t deliver. I will order it from Lehman\\'s catalog. This item is cheaper through them anyway. I will reconsider purchasing any items that go through Target. They also indicated that they would send me a free gift for the inconvenience. Never got it.Anchor Hocking Oven Basics Glass Baking Dish Trio\\n__label__2 Not very well built: I bought this showerhead 2 months ago and when I installed it I threw away the warranty information as I didn\\'t consider it necessary. How often do plumbing type parts fail? Not often or at all based on my past experience. Well, much to my shock this showerhead has in less than 2 months time developed a crack in it. Now I have to go through the trouble of finding the warranty information on it. Not a well built product to develop a crack so soon.Found my warranty information, called them and they sent a replacement piece. It has held up so far, so I\\'m raising the rating on this product from a 1 to a 4 as the manufacturer was prompt on the replacement part and it is holding up.\\n__label__1 making a trap way too complex !?: What is the matter with you !? You take a simple trap and make a bunch of loose parts, doesn\\'t work. very poor design and build.should be a door that locks and a cage so they cant get out. KISS Keep it simple STUPID.\\n__label__1 Full of Errors: I found this book very superficial for the most part. An exploration of George\\'s spirituality is an interesting subject, but there were so many errors in this book that I began to question what was fact or or fiction in discussions of George\\'s spiritual life.\\n__label__2 All that Jazz volume 4: I had looked all over for this CD. After I was about to give up, I checked Amazon.com, it was located without any trouble at all. The delevery was faster than I expected. The CD is great, Amazon.com was great, along with the vender that sold the CD.\\n__label__2 Another entry for the same CD: See my review under the disc\\'s other entry, where you might find it cheaper as well:John Foulds: Seven Essays in the Modes, etc.\\n__label__2 INSPIRING!: I found \"Sailing By Grace\" to be very inspiring! Not only is this book a collection of wonderfully written poems, but the author has taken the time to include a Biblical truth that applies to each of his poems. His opening comments challenge the reader and put the poem in context to be enjoyed to its fullest. Truly a work of art from a man who loves his Lord, his family, his church and those whom he has had the privilege of impacting! I highly recommend this book!\\n__label__1 Sandy Shines Over the Other Material: \"Moments\" a track on the cd, is said to be Sandy\\'s last recording. It is exquisite and worth the cost of the cd, which otherwise is not memorable and at times bothersome as Trevor Lucas\\' voice is very pedestrian compared with Sandy\\'s.\\n__label__1 bad: these mats are poorly designed/made because the plastic is warped and there is no way to securely attach them to concrete (even with stickies).\\n__label__1 Not so smart parking mat: The mats move as the tire rolls over the first bump. This makes them useless as garage parking markers.\\n__label__2 Simply beautiful!: Me and my husband gave this book to each other on our wedding day, which was April 12, 2000. We both just LOVE these poems. The poems are reminding us of how special the little thing in life are... and how simple it really is to make each other happy if you are willing to make an effort for it. I can really recommend this book to everybody who wants to buy a romantic and useful present for the person you share your life with. Useful, because the poems are like guidelines for a succesful marriage. This is a great Valentine\\'s Day of Anniversary present!\\n__label__1 buy 100 SIMPLE SECRETS OF HAPPY PEOPLE instead: This book is VERY boring and I had a hard time continuing to read it. It is one of the worst books I have ever read with very little valuable information. 100 SIMPLE SECRETS OF HAPPINESS is excellent and enjoyable and has a lot of quick valuable nuggets WITH NO 1 STAR REVIEWS. Please read the other 1 star reviews this book has by others before buying this book.\\n__label__2 Amazing and Inspiring!!: This is arguably the best of Iylana\\'s books! This book touched me as it was a combination of Ms. Vanzant\\'s personal anguish, trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous. INTERIORS is a story of one woman\\'s personal journey through some of life\\'s darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant\\'s life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life. It is guaranteed to touch some aspect of each reader in an intimately close manner. Through her pain and suffering, Ms. Vanzant opens up a path of nurturing and healing like none other!Reviewed by Nedine Hunterof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers\\n__label__1 Not very useful: The book does have a lot of great examples, but that\\'s it. Just examples. It shows you what the author created, and then how he did it. It is not very practical for creating your own DHTML scripts. If you try to create something that he specifically didn\\'t do, you\\'re lost with this book. Definitely not a reference book. I just glanced through this thing then stuck it in my desk and haven\\'t touched it since. Graphics are pretty cool though..\\n__label__1 Not a good \"Trap\": I read the Husband and the Wife trap and I really enjoyed both. But I don\\'t like the plot here. How could the hero not see her as a beauty even before the makeover? It seems that he was also shallow and only took notice of her with new hairstyle and gowns? Anyway, here\\'s the turn off and let\\'s fast forward to the scene when he told Eliza\\'s cousin(the villain) to leave England permanently and even suggested to settle in France. Then on the epilogue, he was telling her about a job that would require them to live in France? How stupid was that? Were they following Pettigrew that they were going to be in the same place with the villain and might even crossed path again? Come on... where was your common sense Kit or better yet Ms. Warren.\\n__label__1 Dissapointing figure for an awesome character: Jazz was my favorite character in the movie. Unfortunitly, it seems the fate of his toy is on par with his fate in the 2007 movie. This sculpt makes Jazz look fat and dumpy. His \"hands\" are half-inch spikes of plastic that do nothing but fold out. On mine, the head would not fully pop out. The fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly. His telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon, along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield. The grey plastic looks horribly dull. Jazz is suppose to be about style and cool, not dull. Vehicle mode looks ok. I would pass on this guy.\\n__label__2 Healthy and yummy!: An oldie but a goodie. Book arrived promptly from a private seller. The recipes are healthy and yummy. It is possible to prepare and consume foods that benefit our bodies and brains and this book will help you do that. Recommend highly.\\n__label__2 The game plan: This is an amazing review of history and a blue print of the end. This book outlines the agenda of civilization and it\\'s dire consequence. You can\\'t help from not seeing this play out through the current events of today. Communisum is alive and well.\\n__label__1 Just a BAD Printer: I really want to like Lexmark; I live in Lexington, hometown of Lexmark HQ (all printers are made in China and Mexico), but this is the last one I will ever buy. It is just bad all around:- Feeder jams on just about anything you put in it.- The software is convoluted and confusing (and I work for a technology company!)The print quality is decent but the picture quality isn\\'t good enough for printing photos which is one of the primary reasons I purchased the printer.Finally, the wireless connectivity doesn\\'t work right and required me to physically unplug the printer anytime I wanted to print. FRUSTRATING! I ended up moving it so I could hard wire the machine.About the only positive I can think of is that it looks nice when it isn\\'t printing. Take my advice, buy something else.\\n__label__1 WiFi doesn\\'t cut it: I bought this for the WiFi capability, but it goes down constantly. If you disconnect/reconnect the power it usually works, but if I have to get up to do that, what is the point in having wireless. The printer also tells you that you are out of ink, way before you actually are. Other than that it has been alright. Web support is horrible and based on the reviews I am not even going to attempt to call tech support. I\\'m going to hook it up with USB until I can afford a new printer.\\n__label__2 Job Well Done...: I attended Junior High School with Denetria, she was singing then and she\\'s still singing. This album is wonderful, and I am looking forward to hearing her future projects.\\n__label__2 Lighthearted Mystery: This is a fun, lighthearted mystery with lots of colorful, offbeat characters and Greenwich Village atmosphere. The sleuth is a milliner and while she\\'s solving crimes she\\'s also designing next season\\'s hat collection.\\n__label__1 Phonics Read & Rhyme: Really awful program. I only purchased it because the school also uses it. The Karoke section makes no sense and it says to play a song, but then none of the buttons are enabled to play one. I called tech support and they said this is the way it\\'s supposed to work until the child accumulates tickets. My daughter accumulated all of the tickets, but it still doesn\\'t play any songs in the clubhouse.\\n__label__2 Takes my breath away: This disk is a truly amazing achievement. It combines heart-felt prayer with unbelievably gorgeous music, and provides an inspiring listening experience. To my mind, the most amazing thing about this music is its nearly universal appeal. People who are not Jewish find it compelling enough that they buy it and play it in their cars and at work.I find it spiritually uplifting and musically accomplished. There is another review here which describes the contents of the disk in detail, so I won\\'t do that. Instead, I will just say that I loved this disk the first time I listened to it, and I like it more on each repetition.\\n__label__2 Wife likes it, but the color is a little different than it looks on Amazon.: Like the look of it. The actual product is red, but it looks a different hue of red than the photo on Amazon shows. The color difference wasn\\'t disappointing to us, but we weren\\'t trying to match it to anything. Just liked the hawaiian look.\\n__label__1 Horrible Media Player: I bought this Gameshark disk for the Media Player in hopes of playing MP3\\'s on my PS2. After numerous attempts with each attempt ending in the Media Player just freezing up I finally gave up. I haven\\'t looked at the other things on the disk, but as far as the Media Player, don\\'t waste your money, it is junk. If it were possible I would give this product no stars based on the Media Player, but then I haven\\'t looked at the other stuff on the disk.\\n__label__1 Disappointing: Looking for ways to extend my Spanish I like buying instructional CDs since I spend a lot of time in the car and it\\'s a constructive use of that time. About half of the conversations is on CD, with no rhyme or reason as to what makes it to CD and what doesn\\'t.\\n__label__1 Have lots of scratches on it!: For whatever reason when I opened the package the color was falling apart on several spots! Although the spots are big but they can be covered with the clothes hanging on it! Not satisfied with my purchase!\\n__label__1 Light Use Only !!!: I was originally very happy with this coat tree, but I now wish that I had shelled out a bit more money for a more sturdy and better built one. While it is easy to put together and provides easy access to all items with a revolving top, the design is poor and does not handle much weight. One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed. I attempted to use it with 1 winter coat, 2 jackets, a full length dress coat, and 2 hooded sweatshirts, and ended up having to redistribute the items often.\\n__label__1 Cheap: Bought this coat rack to hold 3 coats by the door for the winter. Within the first week the support leg broke from the cheap construction of the leg supports. I would not waste your money on this rack.\\n__label__1 Outdated and slow, leading to little Magic.: Seeing as there are many other effecient and productive magical systems avaliable for study, it baffles me as to why anybody would want to waste their time crawling along with this one.If you want to actually DO some magic, rather than simply considering it, or stopping short of really trying it (as this course does), then look elsewhere. I suggest Donald Michael Kraig\\'s superb \"Modern Magick\" if the GD tradition appeals. At least Kraig\\'s book gets to the heart of the WHOLE POINT for doing it in the first place, unlike this volume, which only discusses it in scared little whispers.Magic has moved on, and it\\'s time that fact was recognised once and for all.So... don\\'t buy this book, unless you like the picture on the cover.\\n__label__2 This book is liberating to women everywhere: This book is liberating to women everywhere! The reason I bought this intriguing book was that my Grandmother Didi Moorman is actually in the book! pgs., 17, 111, 113, 120, 151.\\n__label__2 Love this idea!!!!: Great idea - my kids were so excited to turn them on and brush the whole time. They are a bit hard to turn on for my 3 and 5 year old so I have to do it for them (no big deal). They are at Target for $1 - stock up (why they are $6 on amazon is a mystery to me - what a rip off).\\n__label__2 Amazing...I was able to set it up in less than 10 minutes: I bought this item for my office for occasional watching of news or special event and to replace my 5\" B/W tv. I was able to install this in minutes and it works extremely well. I can watch TV in a resizable window while working. The picture qyality is acceptable on full screen (17\") but excellent in a 5\" by 5\" window. Sound quality, very good. The only thing that worries me it that the unit gets very hot...but it has vent holes all over for keeping it cool...so, maybe it is supposed to get that hot.I have not tried recording a program yet...but reading other reviews, I understand it maybe a problem. But, for $25 after mail-in-rebate from Buy.com...it is far superior than my 5\" B/W TV with poor sound and flickering picture...I am going to give a proper burial to the B/W TV soon and reduce clutter on my desk.\\n__label__1 it died very fast: it only worked a coouple of times and then it just stoped, not a very good product\\n__label__2 Must Have: Don\\'t be afraid of factory reconditioned. Mine arrived packed and perfect just like a new one except much less expensive. This is a great tool all around. The crown stops and vertical clamp should be included. I\\'ve taken the skin off my knuckles when I let one finger outside of the handle when lowering the blade. It gets caught by the blade guard and takes flesh right off. Minus 1 star for the blade guard removing my skin unecessarily.\\n__label__2 Nothing wrong with reconditioned: Seems to work great. I don\\'t use it for a lot of heavy duty stuff, but for what I have used it for, I can\\'t find any problems. Only negative might be the dust catcher (it doesn\\'t seem to work very well) but I haven\\'t ever seen one that does, so I still give it 5 stars.\\n__label__2 nearlyweds: Beth Kendrick is one of the few writers I\\'ll read in the chick lit genre, and that is because her ideas are original. She stays away from a lot of this genre\\'s cliches, and this book is no exception. It\\'s great for a quick and fun read.\\n__label__2 Its wires: Pretty hard to F up wires. Everything in the description is there in the package. Quality of insulation on wires could be better. None other issues.\\n__label__1 TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst experience with this seller, trough Amazon.The item was damaged, used and dirty.I\\'ve tried contacting the seller and she just blew me off.buyer beware!!!!\\n__label__1 Beware of Headliner, no balls come with this order: The balls work great if you can find them. Beware of this sellers false headliner,\"The Miracle Ball Method: Relieve Your Pain, Reshape Your Body, Reduce Your Stress [2 Miracle Balls Included] [Paperback]\"NO BALLS come with this order and then your are stuck with a book that is not worth sending back.\\n__label__1 don\\'t buy this product from alternate new and used sources!!: I have used this product and been very happy in the past. I gave my set away and wanted to replace it, so visited the Amazon site. My mistake was ordering from another source through Amazon, and although they show the product description as same with \"2 miracle balls included\", only a book arrived. I can tell you that you do not get the same results rolling around on the book. The 2 small balls make all the difference. Be sure that the product description is accurate. I was told by seller that they would not accept return.\\n__label__2 Some relief from back pain: I have some knots and general tightness in my back and was looking for something that might be helpful. I considered some of the back alignment products but hesitated because of the price. Since it costs a fifth of the price of a single massage I decided to try this product. I\\'ve only used it a short time, but feel that it has made a small positive difference.\\n__label__2 works great: I am a dog groomer and my muscles really take a beating. My massage therapist told me about these and how I should use them as maintenece. Wow! am I glad she did my neck and shoulder doesn\\'t freeze up and I can work without pain\\n__label__2 Cured My 20+ Year Stiff Neck: By placing one ball under my neck and rolling my neck around for a few minutes, I am able to turn my neck while driving without feeling the usual stiffness and pain. In fact, I can roll my head in almost any direction without neck pain for the first time in at least 20 years. To work the sides of my neck, I placed one ball on a tailor\\'s ham (used in sewing) so that my shoulder would have room while laying on my side with the ball fully supporting the side of my neck. After 15 minutes of gentle rolling my neck on each side, I have no side neck pain for the first time in decades. I can\\'t recommend this product enough.\\n__label__1 not as I expected: I was so hopeful that this would work. When I used the balls, I found it painful and was very sore the next day. Might not be for people with fibromyalgia. I might try again but I\\'m a little wary.\\n__label__1 These little balls did very little to help my pain.: I am disappointed with this product. Most of the exercises are basic stretches, which do not require the balls. The balls do feel good while using them, but do not provide relief beyond that. In fact, I\\'m not so sure that they don\\'t make painful areas worse. The smell of the balls is horrendous. I have no idea why everyone has written so many good reviews. I\\'ve had several of my friends try them out also and they think that they\\'re just a waste of time. I would certainly not purchase again.\\n__label__2 Great invention: These balls do what they are supposed to do-relieve back pain. Love them. Gave a set to my brother-n-law who has back issues and they did the trick.\\n__label__1 This music requires an almost supernatural technique...: Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone\\'s got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It\\'s interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!\\n__label__1 Nonsense.: Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky\\'s American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I\\'ve heard since Szidon\\'s hysterical Scriabin or Pollini\\'s brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all.\\n__label__2 Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets \"aspects\" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations\\' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.\\n__label__2 Excellent!: This is a WONDERFUL cd of solo and chamber works by this composer. It\\'s amazing how much great music there is out there waiting to be discovered. This guy\\'s music is amazing. It really pulled me in and captivated me. It is approachable, with lots of excitement, but also tons of heart. I\\'m hooked! Highly recommended!\\n__label__1 Technical Errors: There are so many books \\'how-to\\' books out there on mosaic technique. Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I\\'m afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven \\'how-to\\' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest \\'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions\\' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form.\\n__label__2 Great calming liquid: I got a rescue dog and for the first few days he was very difficult. When I left he would bark and howl for hours. My rescue contact suggested that I try Good Boy. After one day of adding it to his water, he became totally different. Slept like a baby while I was gone and when I got home was back to normal. It seemed like I was drugging him b/c it was so effective. But he is very normal and active whenever I was around. Odd. After a few days I decided to stop putting it in his water b/c I was worried that it was too much. But after that, he just stayed calm all the time. I think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner. Ever since then, he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore. It really saved the day for me! (and him...) I recommended it to my friends with over-active dogs and I\\'m waiting to hear what they say after they buy it for their dogs.\\n__label__2 Spell binding civil war stories.: Great collection of classic and some little known tales from a terrific story teller. A master of irony, descriptiveness and sucker-punching endings. You won\\'t be sorry.\\n__label__2 I came back to WaterPik: I had owned a WaterPik showerhead in my previous house.When I moved into this house 15 months ago I purchased a different brand to save a few dollars.I finally went back to WaterPik and I can comfortably say it is definitely worth the few extra dollars.\\n__label__2 My son LOVES this book: My son is 7 months and loves this book. This says a lot since I can\\'t get him to hold still to change his diaper - yet he will sit and let me read him this book over and over. Great for learning bye-bye, peek a boo, and mama/dada and the \\'pop-up\\' Baby Elmo at the end is great and always gets a baby laugh! I am actually going to buy a couple of copies as gifts as well as some of the other books in the series. I highly recommend this book!\\n__label__2 Makes me laugh: Had to have it, laughed when I first saw it. It\\'s been outside my door for two weeks now, and still looks good. May not last a very long time because of the light color, but it was a good purchase for me.\\n__label__1 Not the real book: I thought this was the real book, but it was just the study guide. Make sure to buy the actual book, not the study guide.\\n__label__1 They say it is in stock, not so: Today I get this email from ANTOnlineWe are so sorry to inform you, stock has not arrived as planned for your purchase in our warehouse setup to ship to your location. We are expecting a re-supply truck to arrive with more stock in 5-7 business days. We will ship your order then if you can accept this small delay.Please reply to this email letting us know that it is OK to ship when the stock arrives.Thanks for your order and understanding this small delay.The Support Team at ANTOnlineThe website seed that the item was in stock so i ordered it to replace a power supply in my server. I expected it to ship today! There now emailing me saying that it is not in stock.\\n__label__2 Tells the True Story: I think that this book was a great example of a true biography of a person. Ricky Martin is a great preformer who has only been on this earth for such a short time and has already achived so much sucess with much more to come. This book portrays his life in a great light and allows the reader to feel as if they know Ricky after reading this book. It is not a teen bopper book about Ricky but rather a window into his exciting and sometimes heart breaking life\\'s story.\\n__label__1 Large Butter Knife: Knife arrived dull, with an uneven edge. I\\'ll never buy a another premium grade knife without be able to physically check the edge. I wanted a large \"sharp\" hunting knife for the upcoming moose season, and what I got was a very attactive dull knife that I can\\'t get to take an edge. I thought I was safe buying from Buck, but I guess quality is a thing of the past.\\n__label__1 incredable JUNK!!!!!: After owning this knife for about a year the hanle broke off this cheeseball piece of Buck trash! I paid alot for this unit just to have it break on me ,and if you repair there knife so you can use it that voids the Buck warranty, it costs Buck almost nothing to produce this cheeseball pile of drivle, up yours Buck,I would not take this with me into the woods or steelhead fishing, you want a knife you can depend on and buck is not it!! That is the first and last buck I will ever own or purchase, I have a cheap survival knife from China that I paid $8 for and it has really held up with no problems whatsoever and it holds an edge very well for what I paid for the CHEESEBALL buck trash knife I could buy six survival knives that would last several lifetimes, BUCK SUCKS, lets repeat that BUCK SUCKS, this is the worst company I have ever dealt with bad warranty extremely bad products, and you still suck the big one Buck!!!!\\n__label__2 best knife ever!!!: I am a jusat a regular guy like most of you who are reading this. My older brother bought me this knife 4 years ago for my first trip to BWCA (I\\'v gone the following 3 years as well). I love this knife! I still bring a Gerber multi-tool, but there is no matching my Buck Knife. It does everything, and I mean everything. It has good weight, a great sheath, and holds it\\'s edge. I have totally abused this knife and it still looks and works incredible. There is no better knife for the money! I am a regular guy from Wisconsin, and this is my honest opinion. FYI My Dad also has this knife from over 20 years ago from when we used to live in Alaska and it is also still in great shape.\\n__label__2 Good game Bad graghics: The game is good but grghics bad you know i like the game style because i played all the old versions but it is fun to play..............\\n__label__2 Doesn\\'t Get Any Better!!: What fun it was to sit with my child just 5 minutes a day and watch her become a reader in short order!!\\n__label__2 More than I espected! Great read: What an awesome book. It was more than I expected and in such good condition. I use it as a referance in my studies. Has shed a greater deepth of the Bible in the days of Genesis.\\n__label__1 latin pap: an OK singing voice with a lot of bland orchestral wallpaper; I really don\\'t like this kind of format generally. I could hardly believe the height of the praise in most of the other reviews. Never heard Luis Miguel before but because of other latin sounds I had quite high expectations. Be sure you know what you\\'re getting before you buy this. ...\\n__label__2 classical luis miguel!: Yes I have heard the critics. But let\\'s get real this is Luis MIguel\\'s style. And why should he change into something he\\'s not. He\\'s more Frank Sinatra than he is Elvis Presley and you know what? He is comfortable with that. This Album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer Bebu Silvetti and His Mexican compatriot The master of such hits as \"It\\'s impossible\", \"Adore\", and \"Yesterday I heard the rain\", the legendary Armando Manzanero. This album celebrates love and not sexuality. The songs that stand out in this album are \"Sol arena y mar\", \"o tu y ninguna\", \"Quiero\" Dimelo en un Beso\" and \"Tu solo Tu.\" This album is a combination of pop/Jazz/ballad/classical woven together. This album has up tempo songs and easy listening romantic songs. Overrall this is one of Luis Miguel\\'s best albums. And it includes songs written by the artist himself. The Mexican superstar did a job that he can be proud of!\\n__label__2 Escuchar a Luis Miguel es un Placer: Ana Soto escribe: cada canción me hace sentir algo diferente todo relacionado con la pasión, el amor y la fuerza que Luis Miguel desprende cuando canta una canción. Creo que es lo mejor que he escuchado de Luis Miguel en los 15 años que llevo siguiendole. REALMENTE ES UN PLACER ESCUCHARLO.\\n__label__2 This book explained a LOT!: If you grew up with brothers and sisters, you\\'ll easily recognize yourself in this book as your position in the family is clearly and well identified based on your birth order. This book will surprise you! As a grown adult, it was extremely interesting to read about the patterns that \"first born\" and other siblings exhibit in their lives. And, it explains that there can be more than one \"first born\"! The author has really pegged this topic and I\\'m confident that, while you may not fit every pattern, you\\'ll find that you recognize yourself as you read. It\\'s a great read that we have lent others and received the same reviews.\\n__label__2 4 stars without testing: Hi. I haven\\'t bought this game yet (but i want to and i am debating between this and UNO) but i think it\\'s pretty good by the customer reviews. I love video games, but i am not too good with them, so this would be a perfect challenge for me. I think that the different levels would be a good challenge for everyone that loves (or even likes) video games. I rate this four stars because i haven\\'t played this (yet...) but i think it\\'s great!\\n__label__2 This game absolutely rocks!: This game is one of the best ones I have ever played on game boy, nintendo, playstation and game boy color! It is challenging, fun, and has great graphics! You can replay the levels you\\'ve won in challenge, battle with other players, have your fortune told, and even do bonus levels! You have got to get this game, peeps!\\n__label__2 Good Starter: This book is best used for those people who do not know exactly how to put information together, but do know what they want to add in thier essay. If you do not have previous experience in anything and do not have a story, well then this book is not for you. It gives you great ideas to add into your essay, but it does not spoon feed you the method. The examples in the back are not the best, but they help you draw out some ideas that you would not have otherwise remembered or deemed important.\\n__label__1 Essays that get into law school?: Most of these essays are garbage, foreign to what most people need to know. I\\'m shocked that some of these people got into law school. I\\'m starting to figure out why the profession is a dying one and why no one respects it.Get another one, or search deeper. This is simply a PC book of garbage and generic information on how to write an essay that you learned your first two years as an undergrad.\\n__label__2 Buck is synonomous with superb quality.: I purchased this knife as a more \"traditional\" pocket knife to carry on certain occasions. It is honestly a bit heavy for pocket carry, because it is sturdy and thick; however, that is why a sheath also comes with it. Regardless, I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend Buck Knives to anyone who would want a quality knife.\\n__label__1 Great for beginners to programming weak for actual developer: This book is really the only book available so you have no choice right now. This book was blatantly written for 1.0, which may be ok. It offers great simple examples but offers very little to no help for serious development. Light reading, can finish the book in 3-4 days\\n__label__1 Absolute Junk: It is ashame a reputable comany has not picked this idea up and made a quality, dependable product out of it. It is a priceless idea for the repairmen/technicians. The unit I received did not work on any drive... it was just \"sweat shop\" made junk, never tested or QA\\'d. It was even some generic product... there was no name anywhere on the item or the box.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t work: This device, rarely, if ever, works.It sometimes is recognized by the computer as being connected, and then doesn\\'t show the drive correctly. I have tested this device on three different computers with 4 different IDE drives before I wrote this review.\\n__label__1 UCK: Sabrent USB-2535 Hi-Speed USB 2.0 to IDE Cable for 2.5-inch/3.5-inch/ 5.25-inch Drives & Devices With POWER AdapterThis item is not compatable with 2.5 inch drives as advertised\\n__label__1 Bad Product: Tried this on a laptop drive. Drive powered up when connected to USB 2.0 port, but that is as far as it got - never showed up on computer. Borrowed an external enclosure from a co-worker that worked just fine, so it wasn\\'t my laptop drive.What a waste of money.\\n__label__1 Perfect for tech geeks GREAT FOR BACKING UP: I sure needed this thing my old pc burned out so i needed access to my hard drive and this is the solution for my needs it worked like a charm but my first try i shocked my first hard drive what i did was plug it in the wall and then to my hard dish it shocked it and killed that hard drive...but i learned now you have to connect the usb to pc then the power supply to the HD then lastly to the wall...SO I ASK ANY ONE THAT BUYS THIS TO BE CAREFUL IT CAN BE TRICKY IF YOU DON\\'T KNOW---LUCKY FOR MY I TESTED IT ON A HARD DRIVE THAT WAS\\'NT THAT IMPORTANT TO ME O AND ((I also tryed it with my dvd burner and burned a movie with the burner connect to usb)) it rocksI THINK THE POWER SUPPLY BURNT OUT ON ME I GUESS THATS BECAUSE IT\\'S CHEAP IM BUYING A BETTER ONE ..ONE WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY HAS A ON AND OFF WHICH\\n__label__1 Sabrent USB-2535 USB 2.0 to IDE cable: Good cable to use with spare HDDs. However, for some reason, the USB connector requires inserting and removing from the computer USB connector in order for computer to recognize the Sabrent USB-2535. It is a little frustrating, but it permits me to be able to use the several HDDs that I have collected from old computers without spending too much money for individual external HDD cases.\\n__label__1 Lame Book - Waste of Money!!: What a rip off. A 1st grader would be upset with this lazy, primer. Don\\'t waste your cash. Anyone who has ever had a basic medical term, A&P; or hematology class could have written this. Did not learn anything to help with test. I bought it based on earlier good reviews. The author\\'s relatives must have written them.Kathryn A. Kalanick \"Phlebotomy Technician Specialist: Certification Exam Review\" (also on Amazon) includes an excellent CD with study and test questions based on ASCP, AMT and NCA topics. The book is very good. Detailed review sections, with illustrations tests. Made a high score with this book. (I\\'m not related to anyone connected with this book!)Phlebotomy Technician Specialist: Certification Exam Review (Phlebotomy Technician Specialist Certification Exam Review)\\n__label__2 Good filter: Good filter, It works excellent. It was my first time I bought this brand. I think is a excellent brand.\\n__label__2 Blowing in the Wind - Will they return?: Magnificent flute music to keep the cobwebs away, whether it is heard from the bustling kitchen or from the music room in a quiet moment. A pity it is no longer available.\\n__label__2 Peformance Theory - what is great and what is not in the electronic edition: This is a great book and one that is indispensible for the theatre academic or practitioner. I had it in paper and I decided to buy it kindle format for convenience. There is one problem that I found in some of the kindle books: graphics are not well scanned - small fonts in the graphics are not readable.\\n__label__1 Lacking.: In 1986, no doubt Ronald Shannon Jackson had a challenge on his hand-- the Decoding Society had pretty much scattered, and with the loss of such powerful musicians, assembling a new band to succeed them was a difficult task. The second generation Decoding Society, guitarist Cary DeNegris, bassist Reginald Washington, violinist Akbar Ali and saxaphonist Eric Person on this recording persons in conjunction with African singers/percussionists Twins Seven Seven. The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson\\'s rhythms), but there\\'s by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record. It just doesn\\'t burn. The band did much better work, this is a curiosity piece more than having any intrinsic value.\\n__label__2 OK mat: The cops thought it was funny, but it turns out they already had one. Woud you happen to have a mat that says \"Send bail bondsman\"?\\n__label__1 Great film - horrible DVD.: If you\\'re looking for a bizarre, violent, psychedelic western, with an amazing soundtrack then this movie is for you! Unfortunately, this DVD version suffers from constant heavy compression artifacts (or \"blocky\" pixelization that is especially noticeable in the bright out of focus shots and darker scenes) not dissimilar to bargain-bin, dollar DVD\\'s.This is one of the most disappointing DVD\\'s in recent memory (especially with a $20 price tag) that should be avoided unless you have absolutely no other way to see the film.\\n__label__1 The book is a confused intoduction to the Kabbalah: Chic Cicero has produced a book that is simply a regurgitation of material that can easily be found in the works of Isreal Regardie. The basic premise of the book is that the Kabbalah can best be grasped as a physical reality by walking through the tree. The book lacks any focus on what the Tree of Life is in spiritual terms and instead is a compilation of correspondences from Crowley\\'s 777. From a pragmatic piont of view the exercise of \"Walking the Tree\" simply cannot be done in a normal sized room.\\n__label__1 Not as promising as it seems: I picked up this book on a whim and I just could not make it through half of the book. I was dissappointed and now think twice before buying this author again.\\n__label__2 More like 4and 1/2: It was terrific. It was so much better than I dared hope for. It had it all. I absolutely loved it until almost the end when Lazar pushed Allegra away because he was afraid for her. It\\'s not that this bothered me since so many romance novels seem to do this, it was how viciously he did this. It was almost perfect.\\n__label__1 could not finish it: this book did not work for me. it is pretty sensual but still i could not get into it.just a typical subpar romance that does not have any special quality to it. they have sex too late in the book and after that i really didn\\'t care. i like books that can interest me even after the h/h have sex the first time. this book feels like it dragged on about the first sex because it does not have a lot to offer.\\n__label__2 A book to be taken little by little: Rogues and Vagabonds takes place over quite sometime and has some flash backs. The book is so well written that it is easy to follow.I\\'m taking my time reading to really reflect on the characters because as it says on the back of the book, it\\'s such a conundrum to figure them out as they change so much over time. I haven\\'t even finnished and already three other people are in line to read it. It\\'s great for anyone in the arts business or anyone even thinking of becoming an actor, it paints a picture of what actors go through, the ups and downs. I love this book and recomend it to everyone\\n__label__1 WARNING, INFERIOR BUILD QUALITY: I had a pair years ago, sounded great and built like a tank with Birch Plywood, Just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be, i.e. they still sound great, but they are built like crap using MDF and glue guns. Save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound. Also, dont buy the excuses that they use high quality MDF and it has tighter tolerances,better resins, blah-blah, crap material is crap material.\\n__label__1 Terrible bra!: One of the worst bra I\\'ve ever purchased. Ordered my normal size and the fit was terrible. Unfortunately, I\\'m stuck with it and it can\\'t be returned.\\n__label__2 Breezies Applique bra: Great seller and price! Very comfortable bra and gives nice shape to your bustline under clothes.\\n__label__2 Very Soft: I am very difficult to fit. The material used in this bra is very soft; however, the fit is not very comfortable. It is probably just me. I would say the product is great.\\n__label__1 WanderLOST: A lot of books seem to be taking the approach this one does in terms of writing - completing the whole story in the form of e-mail correspondence between the main characters. While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn\\'t use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it\\'s hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn\\'t a really good book and I wouldn\\'t recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format.\\n__label__1 Dont order from worldofbookusa!: It has been a month since I ordered this book from worldofbookusa and I still have not received it. I\\'m sure the book is great but the supplier is not.\\n__label__1 haunted: A boring and uninteresting book I managed to plow through to page 105 then just could not take any more. Possibly without the teenage daughter it might have had a chance.If there was a zero on rating it would have got my vote.\\n__label__1 Big letdown: Like several other people have commented, I purchased this book based on the excellent reviews. It is a decent story at best. Several things need to be said: it is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, scary. There are several creepy sequences, but that is it; NOT horror. Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless \"build\" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn\\'t building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is \"scary!\" or \"terrifying!\" shouldn\\'t read horror novels whatsoever. I\\'ve read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: I have to admit that I was very disappointed with the novel after reading the glowing reviews. This book was probably one of two books I have never finished. I just could not bring myself to complete it. I honestly found no character that pulled me in emotionally. Everyone seemed to be caricatures of one fault or another, including the father and daughter. In all honesty, my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character. In this book, I found no one. I was turned off by every person in the story. And as for the chills, I did not see what the other reviewers saw.I have never been one to put someone off of something. But this time I just had to write something down. Judging by all of the other reviews, I am in the extreme minority. I may give another of Tamara Thorne\\'s novels a try. It may have just been this particular book.\\n__label__1 False Advertising: Terrible:First of all what is pictured appears to be all copper wire. What I got with my purchase was one side copper and one side silver colored wire.Second-this is not 10 gauge wire-it is smaller than 12 gaugeThird problem-Spool is advertised as 50 feet. My spool contained 43 feet. It appears from other reviews of speaker wire from this same manufacturer/distributor that they are systematically shorting each spool. This is not a 1 time mistake.Cannot recommend this product\\n__label__2 mothers powerball mini: The mothers powerball mini is a great product for polishing the aluminum parts on my bike but I found that it was almost as easy to do it by hand with a rag. This gave me just as good if not better results than the powerball. Also the powerball tears very easily especially in tight areas where it can catch on areas of the bike which is the reason for the 4 star rating.\\n__label__2 A Wiersbe classic that all should read: Christianity is a relationship between God and each believer, with Jesus being the mediator (First Timothy 2:5). That relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out. The easy way out is to make rules about how we should live, such as \"never drink alcohol\" and \"never go to movies.\" Wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer\\'s growth. He explains in simple but precise ways that the Law of Moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things: (1) we cannot please God by following the Law because we can\\'t follow the Law (2)and the Law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the Law. That savior is none other than Jesus, the mediator between a holy God and unholy mankind. Wiersbe\\'s book is simply a great book. Read it and Be Free!\\n__label__1 Time consuming projects!: I love Volume 1 of this series. It has simple, easy to create products. This volume contains much more time intensive projects. Even my avid scrapbook buddies agree that this book is definately not as good as the first one.\\n__label__1 DISAPPOINTED ALSO: BOUGHT THESE SLIPPERS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, AND THE SOLE IS FALLING APART BIT BY BIT FROM WHERE ITS ATTACHED TO THE UPPER. DO NOT BUY!!!\\n__label__2 Following the Endless Road: So, I would never normally pick up a CD like this. But one has to admit that when someone comes out with a pedigree of music like Tuff Jeff, one perks up and listens. The guy has played with some of the Ramones and even worked with David Bowie, you know? So, I can say I was honestly impressed. The CD\\'s got that old school rock and roll feel that everyone can appreciate. It\\'s definitly worth listening to!\\n__label__2 Historical romance, A Gentle Giving: I just finished A Gentle Giving, by Dorothy Garlock, and it was wonderful! This one was not one of my favorites of hers, but it was very good. Willa actually escaped a house in flames, caused by the angry townsfolk, in nothing more than ther nightgown. The family she joins up with, lends her clothing... so not even owning the clothing on her body, she is thrust into the hard life of a wagon trail. When the father is killed, leaving behind two teenagers to fend for themselves, Willa chooses to help them get to their next of kin in the Big Horn Mountains. This was an excellent read... and I\\'m off to read The Listening Sky by Dorothy Garlock now.\\n__label__1 cheap mouse: Left and right click buttons are not very responsive. Sometimes, you do not know if you clicked or not. Other than that, it works.\\n__label__2 This is a fun game: This game is kinda fun. I wouldn\\'t say it is the best game ever, but it is still fun.\\n__label__1 Action packed but hard to enjoy: It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot. To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn\\'t help..he\\'s not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine.\\n__label__1 Not worth buying at all: Unfortunately there is no much details inside, it is not saying or showing how to exercise for the whole body, all what he is doing is posing in front of mirrors, I got no benefit from buying it & I do NOT recommend any one to buy it, thanks\\n__label__2 guitar album delux: i bought this item because of jackie king a guitarist of some interest. although king\\'s solo career is spotty , his work under the influence, and structure, of willie nelson is king\\'s best. king is given free reign in this session and runs the gamut from frantic to west coast western swing. the tracks without nelson are showcases for king. but it is nelson who brings variety and grounding to the session. he also solos on these cuts ( at length on \"my window faces south\") and does some fine playing in a jazz vein. if you like this i would also recommend the earlier collaboration angel eyes.\\n__label__2 Surprisingly moving: Although a documentary, it was a surprisingly moving and warm film. The main character, the faithful monk Tenzin, is very likable, and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher\\'s new incarnation. There is a scene where he revisits his late teacher\\'s now-abandoned and ruined retreat home, and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry. Depictions like that abound in this film - moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world. There are also moments of joy, like the scene where Tenzin and his reincarnated master, now a very young boy, are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass. This is not a story about Buddhism as much as it is a story about love.\\n__label__2 Sunset War; 41st Infantry Div: A gift for my Father. He was in the 41st during WWII. He enjoyed it thoroughly.\\n__label__2 Mind Expansion 101: This book really puts the world into perspective, at least it did for me. Readers would be hard-pressed not to walk away from it with some sort of brain change or alteration to their reality tunnel. The exercises are nice because it puts the content of the pages into an empirically tangible medium.... and yes, you will spot a few \"quarters\"...hahaha...Although it was written late in Wilson\\'s career, I think it is a good book of his to start with because it isn\\'t too jargon-laden. I also recommend the Cosmic Trigger series....\\n__label__1 My last Koontz book for a while......: I have found Koontz to be a masterful storyteller in all of the books that I have read by him (Phantoms, Watchers, From the Corner of His Eye, Intensity), but this book was horribly and unnecessarily wordy and cumbersome. The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided. Pray that this book comes out as a movie, b/c it will take you MUCH longer than two hours to needle through.Wanna read a wonderful book? Try \"The Weight of Water\" by Anita Shreve....it\\'s wonderful!\\n__label__2 Great reading!: This is a great mix of scenes, all convulging on the same story. The characters are so well-written, that as the story unfolds, you cry with them, laugh with them, are driven to experience all of their emotions, amazements and frustrations as if you were with them all the time.Very excellent reading.\\n__label__1 Slow and tedious: I have always enjoyed Koontz and his books, but this is too long, and wordy. In paperback it was 681 pages, it could have been done under 400. It is a rambling and tedious book to read. While I felt I should put it down, I skimmed it, and still got the story. I am one who could have easily put it down at any time. I guess a great author gets his name, and then can write anything and it will be a best seller.\\n__label__1 One Door Away from Heaven: I have read many, many Koontz books...can\\'t ever put them down, however, this one is not very well written. It is EXTREMELY choppy, bouncing back and forth with no real story plot. I am 1/2 way through (has taken over 2 months) and there still is no rhyme or reason to this book. If you love Koontz, I think you\\'ll be disappointed. I was. My husband is almost done with the book and says it doesn\\'t get any better....\\n__label__2 Excellent odyssey through the human experience!: While this wasn\\'t as suspenseful as Intensity, which I believe is Koontz\\'s best work, this is an excellent story with very vivid characters, particularly that of Leilani, a handicapped girl. This story reminds us of what is truly important in this life and to not identify people by their limitations. It\\'s laugh out loud funny at times and definitely keeps you turning the pages. He really gives you an insight into the daily lives and tribulations of ordinary people you might otherwise ignore and depicts them in bizarre circumstances at times that give them an opportunity to show their inner strength in a truly memorable way. It\\'s a book that will make you think and will entertain you in the process!A great summer read!Lynne LoganAuthor of The Crime Chronicles of Decker Zane\\n__label__1 One door away from boredom: I have read most, if not all of Dean Koontz\\'s novels and have loved just about every one of them. However, I found this one the most boring of all and couldn\\'t wait until the end. I usually can read his novels in a short amount of time, but this one I found hard to pick up night after night. Nice try, can\\'t wait for his next one, hope it\\'s better than this.\\n__label__1 Ugh! A labor to read and I\\'m a Koontz fan: The book jumps chapter to chapter slowly describing the characters and does little to tie them together. I usually read Koontz\\'s books so rapidly that I\\'m disappointed when they\\'re over. This book has been a trudgingly slow and boorish read. In comparison to \"Ticktock\" or \"Watchers\" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same. What a disappointment. Pick another one of Koontz\\'s books. Not this one.\\n__label__1 One Door Away From Unbelievable: I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let\\'s keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It\\'s getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do?\\n__label__1 Early disapointment: I never read anything by Koontz, and apparently this was a bad choice to be my first. I read only a part of Kindle sample, and simply could not continue. Mr. Koontz: one does not describe a precocious 9-year old by describing an adult, then declaring her a superintelligent child.Sigh, another bestselling author on my \"don\\'t touch with a ten foot pole\" list...\\n__label__1 Worst Porduct I\\'ve Ever Tried: I just received this item today and headed straight to the tanning salon after work. I rubbed it all over my face and body before I realized that my whole face was on fire. I looked in the mirror and realized my whole body was red. I then ran to the bathroom and washed my face. I then threw on my cloths and ran home to shower this stuff off and cover myself in benadryl. I have never had an allergic reaction like this in my life. I never even got in the tanner, it was all from this lotion. I have been using another Satori Sol product at the salon and loved it. The one with cooling. This one has tingle, which I am apparently alleric too. Try a small packett (or don\\'t) before you buy a whole bottle of this.\\n__label__1 Music for the bagpipe but not by the bagpipe.: Very disappointing for those who love to hear the Great Highland Pipe. Most of the songs have too many instruments to count, and if the pipes are playing you can\\'t hear them clearly. If you are wanting to hear bagpipe music played on the GHP, look elsewhere.\\n__label__1 The worst!: I got this to replace the $9.00 kitchen clock we had by our pool (which despite getting rained on worked for two-plus years). We had just redone our yard and I decided to splurge on something nice (it was \"outdoor\" and copper so I justified the outrageous price). First of all the face was copper not white (as shown) which made it hard to see the time from a distance. This was not a problem however because it stopped keeping the correct time after a couple of weeks. It never stopped completely but the time would vary from 2 to 5 hours off everyday. It was almost a joke to see what time \"Broke Ben\" would say when we went out. If it had been my $9.00 Walmart special this all would be funnier. I\\'m glad to see this item is currently unavailable. I wish it would have been before I got suckered.\\n__label__2 fits, easy install: This fit my 1997 Saturn SL1, was easy to install, and looks and operates just like the original.\\n__label__1 Not good at all....: The only GOOD thing about this phone case is that has a little weather protection and in some situations protects the phone from shocks/drops and that obviously looks cool.The swivel adaptor collapses after 2-4 months of usage, so it makes the release button useless, the phone case will release itself with just a little pressure in the bottom, even if you don\\'t push the release button, the case will fall if you are getting out/in of your car. Think twice before you buy it.\\n__label__2 Squirmy Wormy is Tops!: Peacock Studios has released an absolutely delightful album that will appeal to children of all ages (and adults too!) These songs will stay with you your whole life. If I could give Squirmy Wormy a 6 star rating I would!\\n__label__2 Low Budget But Worth Every Penny: Van Damme portrays a streetfighter who gets caught up in the middle of a raw fighting hard hitting circuit.He keeps fighting to raise money for his brothers family who needs the money or they\\'ll become homeless.The storyline is cheap and the flick itself is low budget but the fight scenes are supurb and the acting on Van Dammes part is excellent.In my opinion of course this movie is the greatest low budget action film available on the market today,if you like martial-arts films instead of explosions and basic killing spree action films than lionheart is your ticket to everything you want to see...Enjoy!\\n__label__2 great for carpal tunnel syndrome: these gloves were recommended to me by a physical therapist who treated me for carpal tunnel syndrome, and they are wonderful. the splint on top provides support but is flexible enough to allow a good range of motion. the beads on the bottom cushion the wrist and keep the hand in a good position while typing. I wear these gloves day and night, and I am able to do almost everything with them on - write, use the computer, do housework, etc.\\n__label__2 Very fun but...: I probably should have gotten something a little more traditional while I\\'m still learning. This music is fun and WONDERFUL, but has a lot of opportunities for a little bit of theatrical movement, and as a beginner, I can barely get the basics down right now. BUT a wonderful add to any collection, I\\'m still listening to it even if I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing!\\n__label__2 Part 2 drops june 2: FOR ALL THOES WHO LOVES MS CLARKS BOOKS AS MUCH AS I DO MAKE SURE TO GET PART 2 TOO THIS ONE. WHICH WAS OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!!!!! GO CHECK OUY HER MYSPACE OR WEBSITE TO SEE FOR YOUR SELF\\n__label__1 defective: Standard AV cables worked fine and very convenient. My fiber optic audio out did not work however which was one of the main reasons for the purchase. NO INFO on manufacturers website about problems. Tried calling the support line and it just tells me the voicemail is full. No response from their tech support through email after 4 days of waiting. Just returning the item for a refund. Companies like this don\\'t deserve my business. Everything with Amazon however was good as always.\\n__label__2 So glad to find one of my favorite exercise videos from the 90\\'s back again! And now on DVD!: Great fat burning video that is joint friendly and is a good workout! Happy to find this one again and now on DVD!\\n__label__2 Much safer than plastic!: I am slowly changing all my food storage containers over to glass instead of plastic. Glass is much safer to store your food in (especially when heating food). This was a great value and over all I am pleased with the set. A couple of the bowls have a slight odd shape to them which can make it tricky to get the lids on.\\n__label__1 Good idea, but needs help!: We bought these bowls about 4 months ago from Amazon. I was thrilled to have glass storage for reheating. However, as others have complained, the bowls have straight sides, so they don\\'t nest well. They are now chipping on the edges and we\\'ve had to throw several out. It\\'s past the Amazon return period.The other problem is that the box came with one less lid than needed.Find a better set. This one just has too many problems.\\n__label__2 does the job: I wanted to get away from plastic storage containers and BPA and so on. These fit the bill. And the fact that you can reheat leftovers in the heavy duty glass containers is a big plus. Rubberized tops could be better designed, but are really serviceable.\\n__label__2 Happy With Pyrex!: I love Pyrex everything! We are trying to get away from the use of so much plastic and disposables, so I purchased this set for home storage and for carrying our lunch to work. These are great! The lids seal tightly and we\\'ve had no leaks. I would advise against stacking these together though: I did have two get stuck and one of them chipped slightly getting them apart. I store them with the lids on to prevent this from happening again. I also love that these are American Made! I will be purchasing more sets of these.\\n__label__2 Great Quality: I love these. Nice sizes. Wish at least a few were rectangular. Don\\'t like that lids are a part of the \"piece\" count. I don\\'t dish wash. Hand wash only. Scared of chipping after reading the other reviews. If you take care of them, they should last.\\n__label__1 If some lids are missing...: .... Amazon will not handle the problem but rather tell you to contact the manufacturer of this product.I received this product with several missing lids.\\n__label__2 Good Product, value for money: I was skeptical of getting glass ware for daily use, but decided to try after reading the reviews. I also wanted to move away from plastic containers. The Pyrex set is really practical and I find it a staple in the kitchen now. The value for money is great and I ended buying an additional set as well.\\n__label__2 Great buy: was everything I hoped it would be at a great price! Pyrex is a great brand and very durable. Would recommend to anyone looking for long lasting storage sets.\\n__label__2 great!: I was looking for some non-plastic containers to put leftovers in, and these did the trick! It does come with a LOT more smaller pieces than I\\'ll probably ever use, but I liked the size of the bigger ones they put in, so I\\'m very happy with it.\\n__label__2 works well: I like leftovers...these work great. They have a couple that are the perfect size for a leftover lunch, as well as some bigger options that will hold a cut-up personal size watermelon.One flaw: they do not hold liquid well. They will leak if turned on their side.\\n__label__2 satisfactory purchase: The item was as pictured and delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I like purchasing from Amazon. Find them reliable and easy to deal with.\\n__label__2 Coolpix Camera Case: The camera case work very good with my Nikon Coolpix L1 camera if you carry no extra batteries. If you carry extra batteries and an extra scancard it becomes very difficult getting the camera in and out of the case.\\n__label__2 Perfect for Nikon Coolpix P2: I read the reviews and felt comfortable enough to get one for my P2. It\\'s prefect for my P2. Like some of the reviews, the interior pocket is pretty much useless if you want it to store an extra battery. You can probably slip an extra memory card in the interior pocket. The exterior pocket is big enough for 2 extra batteries and a couple of memory cards.There is a feature that I didn\\'t see anyone mentioned is that if you don\\'t want to bother with the shoulder strap, you can this case on your belt.\\n__label__2 Elegant and masculine: Very nice knife, I am extremely impressed with the QC of Buck. I have a bald spot on my forearm that is a testament to how sharp it is out of the box. I look forward to acquiring more buck knives in the future.\\n__label__2 Wish it had a skirt on underneath: the face is 10000 times better than the original gabby figure but too bad this one doesnt have her full costume. if u take off the dress shes wearing her top and panties, NO SKIRT! i wish the skirt on the other figure could come off so i could put it on this one\\n__label__1 Headers: Picture of Hedman 88400 headers shows long-tube headers - they are actually \\'shorty\\' headers. Picture(s) should represent actual product!! I had to send my order back and reorder.\\n__label__1 12 bucks for a 312KB .pdf file: Yeah, it mentions \"This is an eBook, not an interactive CD. Please know what you are ordering\" in a separate product description, but what it doesn\\'t say is that it\\'s a tiny .pdf file that ships on a disk in a paper sleeve protected by a standard envelope with a 42 cent stamp on the front. And they charge you 3.99 for shipping.Oh, and if you want, they\\'ll offer you the opportunity to just email the .pdf file to you for the same price and still charge you the 3.99 shipping. Apparently Amazon won\\'t let them email it to you without a shipping markup.According to them.\\n__label__2 Very Powerful little tool: Excellent product-delivers the froth is seconds. It was a great gift. They love it.\\n__label__2 Excellent, but be careful.: Works very well. Just be careful not to bend stem at all. If you do bend it -- say, by running with frother touching side or bottom of cup/glass -- you will likely never get it back to \"true\" no matter what you do. It will probably continue to work, but not nearly as well. We bought a second and are treating it with kid gloves.\\n__label__1 doesn\\'t work: Get yourself a real milk-frother and save the time and money. No matter what kind of milk you use or what its temperature is, this tool will not make STIFF cappuccino foam. Looks cool - but waste of money.\\n__label__2 5th in the series: Heretics of Dune is the 5th title in the Dune series and takes place several thousand years after the events of God Emperor of Dune. It takes as its protagonists several members of the Bene Gesserit as they confront the Bene Tleilax and the Honored Matres- a religous order from the Scattering that took place after the death of Leto II .Herbert\\'s writing continues to improve, and this is the most accessible book yet in the series, although it still not an easy read.\\n__label__2 Fantastic Lens: I have had this lens a short time now, and the weather has not permitted much in the way of outdoor use. The shots that I have been able to take, including some indoor available light and flash, have been superb. Extremely sharp optics with excellent FOV. This lens will probably stay on my L1 body for all-around use.\\n__label__2 oh boy: Let me be the first to say that this is just beautiful. Oh, what a dark, creepy and wonderful recoridng. Wow. It\\'s hard to pick a favorite cut on this one. If you\\'re like me and you love movie themes covered by talented musicaians, then you\\'ll love this.Hail satan.\\n__label__2 Great book!: Tells the story of the uprising and the massacre, along with color and black + white photographs. This book did a great job of explaining the events that took place in an easy to understand fashion.\\n__label__1 DO NOT BUY!!! ZERO STARS!!: Long story short. Bought for daughter for Christmas...it is in the trash...This was THE WORST TOY/DOLL purchase ever!\\n__label__2 AN OUTSTANDING RANCHERA ARITIST!!!: I purchased Nydia\\'s first solo CD when it came out, and have been amazed with her talent since. She not only has endless natural talent, she is a student of her art. Nydia\\'s obvious love of singing is prevelant in her music. I took my grandmother and my aunt to see her in concert, and they were overwhelmed. My mother has compared her on more than one ocassion to the fabulous (and in our opinion the true queen of ranchera), Amalia Mendoza. Amalia never got the attention she deserved, but I sure hope Nydia does. I can only compare her to Amalia and Maria de Lourdes. If you are a fan of Ranchera and Mariachi, you will understand what I mean when I say that Nydia \"cries\" when singing. I love her current album, but I hope that she will make an album of old Mexican standards, such as the one Luis Miguel did. It would truly bring Nydia the attention and respect she deserves. If you ever have the chance, go see her in concert!!!!!! WE LOVE HER IN TUCSON, ARIZONA!!!!!!!!!!\\n__label__2 I found this book to be very helpful: I agree with many reviewers that say \"why would you want to\". However, I found this book to be very helpful because I have been able to identify several toxically self-absorbed people in my life (even in very spiritual circles) and now I can see them in a more realistic way.Karen Anderson\\n__label__2 A great intro to golf for those who are just learning.: While Michelle McGann comes across well in this publication, much of the credit should go to her ghost writer who seems to have done an excellent job in translating a pro\\'s techniques into layman\\'s terms. This is a good book which is a valuable learning tool for those who are just being introduced to the sport. Subjects are discussed in a very simple, concise way, and at no times does the author speak to the reader in a condescending way. A great read.\\n__label__2 Unforgettable Story!: I read an article in the Ladies Home Journal and wanted to read more about this amazing woman. I bought the book and my mother and I have both just finished reading it. What an unforgettable story - and what a strong and courageous woman is Sala! Thank you, Ann, for bringing this to the rest of the world and for all the incredible extra research you have done to fill in the spaces. It is the story of a life that is much too important to be kept in a box. My husband will read this beautifully and lovingly written book next and I have recommended it to my book club. Thank you! Thank you!\\n__label__2 A Great Read: A great read if you are interested in the inside story of the War in the Pacific. It has a lot of relevancy to 2007!\\n__label__2 Compelling: Since I watch a lot of History Channel and war history, Evan Thomas and his book,\"Sea of Thunder\" has put faces on the Sailors, there victories and defeats, both mential and physical. Errors abound, yet understanding the condictions of war at the time makes them less important than the bravery shown by both sides.Once started it is hard to put the book down. Now I\\'m going to look for Evan Thomas\\' book \"John Paul Jones\".\\n__label__2 interesting: i believe there are certain topics that you need to discuss with a potential mate/significant other, and this book seems to be the middle ground between where you are now and where you will be later on. a promising informational book.\\n__label__2 A great staple classic now available online!: Everything is good about this product & its vendor on Amazon.As described, packed well, fresh, arrived quickly!i will definitely repeat this purchase.\\n__label__1 problematic install and wants to reinstall: I have used older Paint Shop Pro versions for years without issue but this version has serious installation problems in that is constantly tries to reinstall itself. After hunting for security products on my computer that would have modifiend the files to make it think it needs to be installed again I found none. Tech support was useless (the usual reponses, \"are you logged on as and administrator\", etc.) as they didn\\'t really read my email about the problem and just sent \"cut-and-paste\" responses to general computer problems. Then the tech support people got rude and told me to \"figure out the problem yourself\". There is a reason why this software is almost free.\\n__label__1 Just forget this software: Software is ok, but don\\'t believe in the rebates. It has been over 4 months now and 3 calls to their company and they have promised me over and over again that they had an \"overwhelming response\" and that it will come in 2 weeks. Now, 4 months after sending the rebate in, the status shows as processing on their web site. Poor company, unethical way of treating their customers.\\n__label__1 Outdated and now just one of many overpriced options: This book was never unique and is now outdated. Why purchase this book when the information contains is now available in many free and more user-friendly formats? The author was merely re-packaging information that has been around all along ... but now she wants you to pay her for it.\\n__label__2 What a great book!: this book is amazingly helpful. i was a new owner of a Mexican Redknee and had NO CLUE how to handle her! she was so sweet, but i was just too afraid to handle her. then i found this book. Princess now has 2 brothers and 1 sister: Paris, Ricky and Jake. they are very sweet animals and the breeding part was helpful as i am getting prepared for my spiderlings :-D\\n__label__1 Great picture, lousy service: The monitor has a beautiful, crisp image. Perfect for my work (CAD, development, web surfing). It also has a neat feature: it will accept 2 DVI inputs from 2 computers and then allows you to toggle between computers with a button on the front panel. Sadly, this feature stopped working after roughly 8 months of use.When I called HP to claim a warranty repair, I was transferred to a service agent in another country. After 20 minutes of repeating and correcting serial numbers/model numbers I was told that this monitor was not in their database and therefore I could not be helped. What the heck! I offered to email pictures of the model number sticker, fax copies of the invoice, etc. All to no avail, the \"service\" representative declined my request to speak with a manager to resolve the issue. So I guess I\\'m just stuck with a half-broken product.In the end, it\\'s still a nice monitor, but I\\'m frustrated with the lack of customer service.\\n__label__2 An all time classic: A wonderful collection of the original X-wing game, with the two add on campaigns. Sure the graphics are old, as are the sound effects, and some of the missions are nigh on impossible, but it is still hard to beat for the re-play value. For any who enjoyed the original, or would like to see where the more modern versions of the same game come from, this is one to get.\\n__label__2 Not your usual tough-guy cop story but a human one.: This story, told in the first person, is an imaginative and interesting look at what a New York City detective really is...a human being with human frailties. It is also a really good mystery. I look forward to more from Mr. Dee.\\n__label__2 Easy to install - slightly quieter than my old Nutone fan: This fan is actually cheaper than the previous Nutone ceiling fan that I installed 25 years ago in the kitchen above the stove. Installation is simple if you have easy access to the attic and possess some basic knowledge of electrical connections. I expected it to be significantly quiter than the old Nutone \"airplane propeller.\" It is, but only slightly.Still, I recommend it. The fan does the job, and the price is right.\\n__label__1 Seal between layers breaks too easily.: This is the 3rd of this type of travel press I have had, and all of them seem to have this problem. I\\'ve only had the latest one for less than a month, and now the seal is broken again. I\\'m really quite disappointed. I expected more from Bodum.\\n__label__2 Niece loved it, her father didn\\'t I sa: I saw an ad for this product in a magazine, ordered it here and had it shipped (Prime) to my niece for her 6th birthday. It arrived promptly and she loved it. She immediately sat down and \"sculptured\" some things. Later I heard from my sister that although she could cope with the mess (as bad a playdough apparently) her husband could not, and had sent a message saying if I ever sent any of \"his kids\" this stuff again he would fly here and feed it to me! LOL It must REALLY be a great toy for a child!\\n__label__2 the kids LOVE this!!!: This toy is incredible and durable. Hours of play!!! Exceptional for airplane rides. Amazing how well it keeps the attention of the kids (and adults).\\n__label__1 metal connector nails unavailable in 2 1/2\": I was going to buy this for a deck job. The Bostitch joist hangar nails are horribly overpriced on Amazon and not available locally. My local guy told me Bostitch is no longer supplying the 2 1/2 metal connector nails. He just shrugged when I asked about the future availability of the 1 1/2 inch metal connector nails. He said they might just be selling out what they had and there would be no more. However, that was just speculation, as Bostitch ain\\'t talkin\\' .....Will search more first.Either that or buy a brand with reasonable nail prices. I will have to do a nail count to see if the saving on nails will pay for buying a Senco Joistmaster.\\n__label__2 Nailed it: Excellent nail gun. Easy to set the nail depth. With this full head type nailer, the nails come with more plastic connector material in between than clipped head nails. The full head naila are good nails with no jams. But sometimes the plastic connector debris needs to be picked away from under the set nailhead to produce a smooth finished surface.\\n__label__2 No comment: I bought this thing thinking it would be something special. It\\'s pretty cool. It fits the computer nicely, doesn\\'t scratch etc. However it\\'s made pretty cheaply and made in China. The stitch on the inside doesn\\'t appear to be sown all that well. However, for $30 it does a great job of giving my 17\\' Mac Book pro a nice smooth small and durable case.\\n__label__2 No Gimmicks: Simply a great, high quality knife. No tricky lock features or \"tactical\" blade styling. Just and excellent all-around folding knife. Good quality steel, super grippy handles, and a blade that opens so smoothly and quickly that there\\'s no need for assisted opening. You can\\'t beat it for the price.\\n__label__1 What a piece of trash!: Although described as a hardcover, I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and there was NOTHING in it that was not in the Dragonolgy text. It was also NOT a hardback, but a little pamphlet in a box with a cheap bit of plastic token. Definetly not of the quality of Dragonolgy.\\n__label__1 throw away: After trying everything we could and spending an additional 162 dollars for ink we will throw this new machine away. I would give it to someone but I think it would be such a disservice that I would lose friends instead of helping. Hewlett Packard used to make good printers. This is the third and final junk printer and the worst even Hewlett Packard has perpetrated on us yet.We have a new policy at our company. If it says Hewlett Packard the answer is no.\\n__label__1 No more monthly fees please!: I am an old school D&D; fan and love online gaming. I am sorry though, $40+ for a game and then a monthly charge and a small lvl cap that people reached in mere days?? I don\\'t care how much fun a game is, LOSE the monthly fee! There are tons of great FREE online games./off soapbox now.\\n__label__1 Dissapointment is an understatement: I got this game as a birthday, and was very excited to try it out. Needless to say I played the game for nearly a week before giving up completely.The idea behind it is great. An MMORPG that doesn\\'t revolve around killing endless amounts of rats and pigs to level up. It promoted party-based adventuring to the extreme. The modules/quests were self-contained. Everything seems just great.But the execution for this game is extremely poor. The quests just aren\\'t much fun. The combat system is ok. The way leveling is done doesn\\'t make much sense, especially for a game based on D&D.;I dunno, I found this game extremely boring (even for an MMORPG). This game was my second time trying games in the MMORPG genre, and it\\'ll definitely be my last...Don\\'t waste your money.\\n__label__1 Poor quality control by Lenox: I have received two of these through Amazon (one as a replacement for the first) and in both cases the center \"basket\" design is off-center. I measured it... they\\'re clearly off-center. Amazon was wonderful in working out the return.Updated review: I have since received one of these directly from Lenox, and it too has an off-center \"basket.\" This is clearly a design flaw in the product.\\n__label__1 PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FLAVOR: Please, please, please, please, PLEASE bring back the old Spearmint Altoids flavor! They used to be my favorite type of Altoids until this New \"Great\" Taste came and ruined them. This new flavor is not sweet at all and just tastes all-around disgusting. It\\'s bitter and tastes like those foul cough drops that, no matter how bad a cough I had, I would never make myself take. You took a wonderful thing and changed it for the worse - much worse. Please revert back to the old recipe!\\n__label__1 Why did they change a good thing???: I\\'ve been buying the Spearmint Altoids for years, and loved the product. I just got a new tin of the \"New Great Taste!\"--which is horrible! It tasted like menthol! Such a drag. I see now that there are more artificial ingredients in it. WHY??? I hope the company sees the feedback and reverts back to the original recipe. Or they\\'ll lose a lot of customers. They\\'ve lost me for now.\\n__label__1 Zzzzz: The concept of bringing together smallpox and HIV in an historical crucible intrigued me, and I thought I would find the story about using young boys to perpetuate the smallpox vaccine scientifically interesting. The latter was true, but the more I got into this book, the more I actively disliked the main character, Alma. A growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book. The author, in my opinion, wasted my time on needless, and seemingly endless details that added nothing to the story for me but pages, time, and effort.Though the book apparently appeals to some, it was an experience in reading drudgery for me. Nuff said.\\n__label__1 Complete Drivel: The author was more impressed with his being a team leader that doing justs to the historic Peshtigo fire. The mundane radio calls and flash backs didn\"t help his effort.\\n__label__1 does not keep mosquitos away: I covered my son with this spray, and he was in the woods for 15 minutes, and came out with 11 new bites. He is prone to mosquito bites, but this did not work at all. I don\\'t think the amount of Deet is strong enough. 7% compared to 20% in deep woods.\\n__label__1 Boring: I thought this book started out interesting, but it kept getting more and more dull. I finished the book anyway, because I thought it would get better towards the end, but it didn\\'t. I don\\'t recommend this one!!!!!!\\n__label__2 The right tool for the job!: We needed a 3.5mm Mono Female / RCA Male Adaptor to connect to our phone system\\'s music on hold RCA input connector. To connect this with our audio source, we coupled this with a very reasonableCables Unlimited AUD-1100-25 3.5mm Male to Male Stereo Cable (25 Feet, Black). The price was right for the whole package. This little piece of audio hardware was essential in making it work.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t work well to change my feelings.: From my experience, these kind of healing books don\\'t work well to change my feelings and attitudes. They do have temporary effects, but do not last long. This book also was not the execption. There are many \"Things To Do\" which I should do right now to change my life. But I don\\'t and can\\'t do these \"Things\". Always when I read such kind of books, I am firm about trying to do these \"Things\". But I don\\'t take a whim for reading these kind of books again and thus lose an opportunity to do good \"Things\" entirely. I think volunteering for building GESUNDHEIT INSTITUTE in WEST VIRGINIA and meeting PATCH ADAMS is much more effective than reading this book.\\n__label__2 ABC Fun!: My three year old loves this DVD! After renting it from Redbox about three different times, I finally found it on Amazon! Educational and fun! Highly recommend to any preschooler!\\n__label__2 Great story and illustrations: My children and I really like this book. I appreciate the realistic situation in which the little boy is tempted to lie. I think my children could really see something they relate to and they could see the moral of the story about how lies get out of hand. Great book!\\n__label__2 All of the Sissi movies: I saw all Sissi\\'s movies 40 years ago, I will like to have it in Inglish or Spanish on DVD. Is it possible or not?\\n__label__1 Slow duration time ruins it all!: This is a good camera in terms of its functions--yes, but this camera\\'s achielles heel is that it takes too long to actually take any pictures--they turn out blurry because it doesn\\'t take the picture when you hit the button. It needs time to focus, or just to respond to your touch. It is even worse with flash, the camera takes too long to come back after taking a flash photo--so if you want a so-so camera that operates well, you can get this---or you can get that anywhere...it\\'s all about what you need this camera for. I want to take pictures that I can rely on 100% to take when I hit the button---it\\'s not with D-435...\\n__label__2 A whole lotta\\' \"Huh?\": This book is unique in that it is the first book that you need that you won\\'t understand. I was directed to purchase this book by a professor who was a student of Layton. I wanted to better understand the gnostic traditions and this book works to explain the gnostic mind in mind-numbing detail. The western, Enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don\\'t exist in the rubric of rationalism. They are mythology. The gnostic scriptures are more like reading Hesiod\\'s Theogony or Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses than the New Testament. If your goal is to truly understand gnosticism Layton is indespensible. However, if all you want is a general understanding of gnostics, avoid this book. It will only muddy the water. You have been warned.\\n__label__2 Beautiful!!!!!!!!!: Ordered this product about a year ago and I am disappointed I forgot to post a review. This Halo was perfect for my brother\\'s wedding and matched the dress we ordered to the tee. I couldn\\'t be more pleased with this product\\n__label__1 Verbose and poorly written: We used this book for our materials science class, and while it contained a lot of information the information was very poorly presented. The text would often refer to figures and tables nowhere in the vincinity, and it was written in such a way that it was extremely difficult to follow. They didn\\'t emphasize the important parts, so it was unclear what we should\\'ve known.\\n__label__2 Buy it!!!!!!!!!!: What more do i have to say .....jim roberti ..the name should tell it all. For those of you who know him well you know what im talking about, for those who dont well let me explain real quick. You name it Jim a.k.a \"the man\" Roberti can sing it all you name it he can sing it better. thats right.. better....jim im a big fan and love your music, cant get enough.. keep the poconos happy with your awsome music, your the best..ill see u monday, tuesday..\\n__label__1 Fear-Mongering and Inaccuracy are the real agenda here: I was unfortunate enough to come across this book at a local used book store and since it was dirt cheap, I decided to read it because I was curious. What I found was absolute drivel. Its anti-gay rhetoric is designed to reinforce negative attitudes toward homosexuals, which it accomplishes vie generalizing, stereotyping, and the presentation of purely inaccurate information. Those who are already militantly anti-gay will find what they\\'re looking for (lies to back them up) and those who are not will alternate between horror and laughter at what this book tries to do.\\n__label__1 Scare them into Heaven: I have read many commentaries on homosexuals and the church. This book dehumanizes the homosexual community. It tells lies about the homosexual community and it keeps homophobia going. This gives the people the Right to go kill or threaten homosexual people.If you read through church history and even read the Bible for what it is there is nothing in there about homosexual acts. I believe the best book out there that best tackles this topic called \"Dirt, Greed and Sex\" by William L. Countryman.For those that read the book and stated that they are scared of what \"agenda\" the homosexual community has, its beyond me. People do not do enough research and/or reading. I read both sides then come up with my own decission. I don\\'t have someone else tell me what to believe, I search it out.\\n__label__1 I\\'d give this book negative stars if I could: Newflash homophobes of the world! You guys are STUPID! It\\'s doesn\\'t take a big novel full of junk and conspiracy to tell the rest of the world that you have the IQ of a tree stump. Please, no more silly books pretending there is some kind of big issue, please no sequel. Go sit in your corners and pity yourselves for being so close minded.Nobody should read this book, for the sake of keeping their brain cells!\\n__label__1 Embarressed Christian: I am so tired of anit-Christians embarressing (and saddening) the rest of us by their egregious, SINFUL hatred! Every point in this book revels the author to be just another of those self-rightious, ignorant, scared people who have no understanding of the Love of Jesus Christ, yet want to validate their fear and stupidity by saying and doing the most horrible things in the name of God.Please do the rest of us a favor. HATE in your our space and, please, actually read the first four books of the New Testament. Jesus Christ preached against judging others, summing up the whole thing by relating the Golden Rule! (It\\'s right there in the New Testament in case you have no idea about what I am referring.)\\n__label__1 Factual Inaccuracies: I was disappointed that the authors of the book did not take a more balanced viewpoint. For instance, no mention is given of the fact that a homosexual co-founded the modern conservative movement along with William Buckley, or converted the civil rights movement to non-violence--Bayard Rustin, and organized the famous March on Washington where Martin Luther King gave his famous \"I have a Dream\" speech. The authors seemed to come to the topic with their conclusion in hand and sensationalized some fairly boring situations to make their point. There are better books on this topic.\\n__label__1 Typical Alarmist Drivel: The authors\\' claims are unsubstantiated, with flawed reasoning and research. They are deliberately negative so as to further their own agenda of hate and intolerance. It is one thing to believe your god says it is wrong, it is another to deliberately and maliciously twist the facts of something so it fits what you want to believe. The former is merely a difference of opinion. The latter is downright dishonest.The glbt only want the same rights accorded everyone else. No more, no less.\\n__label__1 Paranoid Psycho Babble: Reading this book made me wonder my mothers old addage of a bunch of folk who don\\'t have nothing better to do than cause trouble ... don\\'t they have a job? Yeah, writing this sick paranoid thesis on hatred. This whole \"us verses them\" thing has to stop in this country (USA)... or our freedom is at an end.If you don\\'t want to be homosexual ... then don\\'t be, but playing politics as suggested is a terrifing exercise in fascism.In about 20 years all of this version of freedom of speach will come to an end ... yes, no more Focus on the Family, no more KKK, no more Fox news, just like spam is about to be outlawed so is the paraniod ramblings of talk radio. Bending logic and science to suit you doesn\\'t make a country progress ... it makes it fall on its tail. I could come up with a dozen reasons why homosexuality is wrong, and still have no right to feel the need to down someone over their sexual impulses.\\n__label__2 All These Years, and Still, not a weak track: Usually after an artist has been out for a few years, they start getting nice and their songs are not as good, not Bone Thugs-n-Harmony though, they\\'re still just as good as when they came out.Flow Motion 7/10Bump In The Trunk 7/10Wind Blow 7/10I Tried 8/10Lil Love 8/10, I don\\'t usually like Bow Wow but this song was pretty good, Jermaine Dupri just needs to shut the hell up.C-Town 6/10, AlrightOrder My Steps 5/10 AlrightStreets 7/109MM 9/10 One of my favorite songs on this whole albumGun Blast 9/10, another good oneCandy Paint 7/10So Good, So Right 8/10Sounds The Same 8/10Never Forget me 8/10.Buy it.\\n__label__2 Its About Time for this change: I admit it I\\'ve been a fan of Bone since the Faces of Death days truthfully probably their biggest fan but in all honesty Bone has disappointed me a few times. Its not their last few cds wasn\\'t good its just that I know as well as all of you know that Bone can rip some trax when they want to. This cd (I hpe and pray) is a sign of their future cds because this cd is the first in a looooong time that I see them live up to their potential. They rip damn near every track almost as good as East 1999. This cd in my opinion is a great investment and a must have for every Bone fan or anyone who like fast tongue twistin rap. I give Bone nothing but love for this cd and pray that their next one is even just half as good.4.3 (its great but its no East 1999)\\n__label__2 My boyz are back: I love this album... been a fan since creepin on ah come up and I have been very critical of them on their past couple of albums. This one reminds me of the old Bone Thugs but with a more updated sound. I love it and any one who hasn\\'t heard them entire album needs to go pick it up soon! Love my boyz!!!!\\n__label__1 Awful: I enjoy the game of golf as much as anyone. I enjoy great golf architecture, and I enjoy well written novels. Mr. Shackelford may enjoy golf, and may appreciate good golf arcitecture, but he should leave novel writing to creative writers. He is not a bad writer, but fiction is not his fortay. Don\\'t waste your time reading this one.\\n__label__1 Zareba K9 Electric Fence Charger - Don\\'t Buy This Unit: Very disappointingZareba K9 Fence Controller for Zareba Pet and Garden Kit. Just doesn\\'t work, and after several calls to the manufacturer\\'s tech support group - who are pleasant and helpful, they said to return it (but from the techie\\'s comments it sounds like they get a lot of complaints about the K9 unit.) And NO, it wasn\\'t my wiring, since my 17-gauge galvanized wired fence line with porcelain insulators activated just fine as soon as I connected it to a Havahart charger SS-725, which, unlike the K9, has a conventional ground terminal.\\n__label__1 Not as good as I thought: My daughter wanted a caterpilliar and I bought this for her. But this worm is not fluffy. You can get a better toy in a local store with this price.\\n__label__2 Thanks amazon: I really like using theBrother Black Toner Cartridge (TN-350) in my printer I know what to expect and the quality is certifiable, not so with the re-fills, plus there\\'s seldom anyone to stand behind the re-filled product, but I hate the ordering process, creating an account with passwords, entering your address 2 or 3 times it\\'s a hassle amazon de-hassled the ordering system with one click, plus I saved money and got the genuine cartridge. Thanks amazon.\\n__label__2 Toner Cartridge: This toner cartridge for the Brother HL-2040 comes close to the advertised number of copies is suppose to make, and buying it through Amazon with the free shipping, beats every price in my area.\\n__label__1 Not Brother: I purchased Brother toner. I got a refurbished product, with toner powder leaking out of the packaging. On the positive side, I decided to take a chance with it, and so far it is working.\\n__label__1 Not as good: We bought this cartridge back in June and and it already dried out and is no longer functioning after a few hundred copies. Previous cartridges we purchased from office supply stores lasted for over a year and was good for a few thousand copies. I would rather pay a few dollars more and get a longer lasting cartridge.\\n__label__1 A product of Planned Obsolescence: I was one of the first to reveal that a bit of masking tape placed over the tiny window would extend the cartridge life by more than 40%. Since that time, I\\'ve stumbled upon this very informative video.The Light Bulb ConspiracyThe Untold Story of Compulsory Planned ObsolescenceIt appears I\\'m not allowed to promote websites in these review. I\\'ve put enough to help anyone wanting to watch this. You can figure out what\\'s needed in order to watch this below.[...]Pass it on...\\n__label__1 WASTE OF MONEY: THIS BOOK DID NOT DETAIL HIS FAMOUS SHOOTOUTS. IT TALKED ABOUT HIM MAKING UP HIS OWN RELOADS AND SHOOTING PEOPLE WITH THEM. TODAY YOU WOULD GET LOCKED UP BY NOT USING FACTORY AMMO.THE PROBLEM IS IN COURT THEY WOULD SAY MR. SO AND SO COULD NOT USE JUST FACTORY AMMO HE HAD TO MAKE UP HIS OWN KILLER BULLETS. NOTE THIS BOOK IS JUST OLD AND OUT OF DATE. I DO RESPECT THE AUTHOR FOR THE GREAT JOB HE HAD DONE. THE POLITICAL SIDE OF HE BOOK IS GOOD BUT NOW ITS EVEN WORSE.\\n__label__2 Great to have!: Works well as long as you can convince your family to use it!The stainless steel makes it hard to see on black dishwashers in dimly lit kitchens but it\\'s not too big of a problem.\\n__label__2 Works Great: Looked all over for a dishwasher magnet so I could stop putting post-it notes on the front of the machine when it hadn\\'t been run yet - this magnet is well made, simple design looks great, and it works! Was a little concerned after reading the reviews that the magnet might not be strong enough since my D/W has the plastic panel on the front - but it sticks and stays. Very well satisfied with this product.\\n__label__1 Ok......for the price.: These paper towels are definetly at the low end of the budget for paper towels. Are they worth the low price I paid for them....yes. I knew it was a risk purchasing them considering how low they were priced. Each individually wrapped package had several paper towels hanging out of it and when you open them to put them in the dispenser you end up having to remove the first 4-6 paper towels to get to the ones that actually pull down nicely. Again given the price this is to be expected. The paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating. You end up using twice as many to dry your hands as you would if you had purchased a higher quality paper towel. This is a case of you get what you pay for. If you are looking for budget paper towels and don\\'t mind the above you will like these.\\n__label__2 Best Zorro Ever: I\\'m 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions. Do NOT try to \"compare\" it to the Disney series. They\\'re totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more \"meat\" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults.\\n__label__2 Big Bang Theory: The fifth season is hilarious and I really like to watch them in order. I cannot wait to get the next season when it comes out on DVD.\\n__label__2 great stuff: was still new as stated, good condition, plays perfect, arrived early, nothing but laughs for this product. nothing but compliments from me.\\n__label__2 the best show ever: This is a brilliantly written show and I would recommend this to every one. Its going to be a sad day when it goes off the air.\\n__label__2 Gift: My son LOVED this gift. This is one of his favorite tv shows, so it was a hit with him for sure.\\n__label__1 Big Bang, fifth season: I own the DVD sets for all five seasons. This series continues to be somewhat entertaining but the humor continues to more and more for a Junior High level audience. As an \"older\" viewer, I emjoy smart television and movies along with those containing a generous amount of slapstick comedy. And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form. Each and every show has at least one and usually more than one reference to bodily functions that I find unfunny and tedious.Wake up Hollywood, teenagers don\\'t have money, we do. I would give this season two out of five stars.\\n__label__2 Absolutely wonderful!!!: Best season yet!!! Loved every minute of it. All the characters have gotten more hilarious and sheldon is more priceless than before!\\n__label__2 Always Funny: Love every season and this is one of the best...... I can not get enough and can\\'t wait to add season six.\\n__label__2 Just as great as the rest.: My package came very quickly and was in perfect condition when I got it. Big Bang is hilarious and I will be watching these episodes over and over again! The ultraviolet digital copy is really weird because you cannot actually download the episodes and do what you want with them. You download them to an ultraviolet client and watch them within the client.\\n__label__2 Still great: While the previous season was simply fantastic, season 5 is almost as good. It does somewhat lack some of the more hysterical pieces in last season but overall it is the funniest show on tv or DVD at the moment.\\n__label__2 Funny, Funny, Funny: This season of episodes continues to provide the \"laugh out loud funniness\" that I found in the earlier years\\' episodes.\\n__label__1 less than OK: The show itself is wonderful and I have been watching it in order from start to finish. My DVR didn\\'t record this particular show and I could not figure out any other way to watch it right away. So given all that I was on the desperate side. The quality was not good. I got the story line, but the quality was \"jerky\" and fuzzy. I hope I never need to watch any more episodes this way.\\n__label__2 Great!!!: Love this show! It\\'s also great that it includes blue-ray, DVD, and ultraviolet options! The purchase arrived ahead of schedule and in great condition.\\n__label__2 Super funny: nice no commercials and best episodes we have been watching it during the holiday break as a family and enjoy\\n__label__1 Annoyed: I wish I had read the review before buying this item, as the playlist shown by Amazon bears no resemblance to the real list of tracks.In Particular the one track I was desperate to get was \"I Will\" by Ruby Winters, was not on the actual CD, I am really disappointed.The only positive was that the CD was delivered within 1 week, and was in good condition.\\n__label__1 Good Theory, Vague and Outdated Code: This book is a good start for those who want to work on the guts of their own mud. The target audience seems to be accomplished C++ programmers. The author assumes a great deal of expertise on the part of the reader; I for one was left in the dark on many topics.The code examples on the companion CD are not fully explained in the book, and I found several code snippets in the source files that had no mention at all in the relevant chapters. The code examples also will not compile on newer versions of GCC without a great deal of work.This book is a good intro to network programming, and does a good job of outlining what is needed to design and code a MUD from scratch, but I would stay away if you are not already an accomplished programmer.\\n__label__2 wonderful: I really like how firm this brush is when handling the hair. I am a hairdresser and I have been blowing out hair for 16 years :) This is a great brush :)\\n__label__2 Camera power supply: Arrived on time for my presentation. A must have for extended camera use. A real battery saver.\\n__label__2 Excellent book for elementary age children!: I am a School Psychologist and Mobile Therapist and this book has come in handy on many occasions. I work frequently with students who have been diagnosed with Autism, and I have found that this is one book that students really enjoy. There are great pictures and stories that my students love to see and read. We typically act the stories out afterward either in person or with dolls/action figures. No matter how resistant the students are to the rest of the activities, they typically consider this a rewarding experience. I would recommend it to all school staff and parents who deal with students that are lacking social skills in some way.\\n__label__2 The best book for teaching social skills and I\\'ve used several!: I bought this book to help teach my 4 year old with Aspergers about how to deal with social situations. The book uses real photos of children in various situations to teach the right way to do something, like stand in line, and also shows a photo with the wrong way. It explicitly teaches, among other things, how to approach other children to play, how to ask a teacher for help, and how to have a conversation. My son loves reading the book together and I can already see him implementing the lessons after just a few weeks. For visual, step-by-step learners, this book is perfect. I own at least 6 books on teaching social skills and this is by far the best and most effective one I\\'ve used.\\n__label__2 GREAT COMPACT PILL CASE.........: Great if you have more than one or two pills to take every day.... I have to take meds in the PM as well, so I have a green Pill Reminder for my evening meds.... these containers hold five plus pills, depending on size.... plenty of room in each compartment..... Hard to find this type of container at retail stores......\\n__label__2 Best Shape for Me: These 7-sided pill keepers (my family calls them \"pill wheels\" but you\\'ll never find them that way on Google) are, in my experience, the best shape for this sort of thing. Round ones cannot be set up on their edge, and the \"stick\" style, with all the days in a horizontal row, don\\'t tuck as discreetly into a purse or pocket.It\\'s hard to find these in stores. This is a great price and I\\'ll order several.Note: if you can\\'t easily distinguish which are your morning pills and which are your evening, you\\'d best buy two of these and load them accordingly.\\n__label__1 Works but Nothing Special: I had a \\'live and learn\\' moment with this bottle cap opener. I saw a similar one at a party and decided to purchase three for Christmas presents. I unfortunatley did not read reviews nor did I realize that this was coming from the UK, nor did I realize that the shipping costs were astronomical (almost more than the cost of the three openers.) My order was placed on December 8th and after three days I was notified that I would recieve them by January 7th. Obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through Amazon, I was told the openers were on their way and I did, in fact, recieve them after 10 days. I also expected the openers to look like the picture. They did not. It\\'s a plain opener. It does not say Worlds Greatest Bottle Opener. It\\'s plastic. It works, but it\\'s nothing special. Disappointed for sure. I\\'m usually smarter about my purchases, but have always had good luck with Amazon and just let this one slip by. So...live and learn.\\n__label__1 7-1 Joke: At such a great price.. Of course I bought two.. Hoping I would make at least 3 actualy 4 hour uses out of it.. Boy was I wrong.. The unit looks great and will hold a nice size camera (weight wise); Issue is the hinges and other items fall apart..Worth $5 and free shipping not worth a more than 3 time use..ZERO STAR\\n__label__1 let down: I was very excited to receive this tripod but was sad to find it arrive to me package fine, with the top part broken off inside.\\n__label__1 Not worth the mony: What a pice of crab ,,,, I know that is not the most expensive thing but ,, really No way I\\'m putting my Camera on this toy,,, I don\\'t think that is a real stable tripod because there is a big chance that might fall of and break your camera ...!\\n__label__1 Nice case, but poor tripod.: The case is fine, but the full sized tripod is flimsy. I purchased three for a field project and one broke on first use. Super glue fixed it. Overall, I am OK having made this purchase because the overall cost was reasonable. If you want something that\\'s rugged, however, I\\'d stay away from this product.\\n__label__2 Incredible layout!!!: I bought this book for my plant biology class. Even though I was required to only study about 3/4 of it, I read the entire thing from cover to cover. If you want to find out about plants and the natural world, take a course with this book or just buy it and read it like a good non-fiction book. The layout and format are very modern and appealing. There are sections on ecology, which are very important in understanding what is happening to our environment right now. Plus, the book doubles as a plant reference/gardening book because it has a monster appendix with stats and care information on tons of common and rare plants you might grow at home. Wonderful book, you won\\'t be disappointed if you are curious about natural science!\\n__label__2 Soon to be your litte ones favorite toy!!!!: I can not say enough good things about this product!!Our 1 year old LOVES it. Well made, colorful, and packed with fun it is a fantastic product. I highly recommend this toy.I simply can not tell you how much your children will enjoy it.Purchase it and I guarentee it will soon be your litte ones favorite toy.\\n__label__2 the best naval flight recalections ever: If u like anything with flying, naval flying, this book is the best. it has all of his expereiences and makes u feel like u are really there. i would recomend this book for anybody but if u would like to become a naval aviator like me, then this book is especially for you!!! The best book i have ever read Admiral Gillcrist. thank you especially for writting about your career! i plan on reading the other books by you. i rate this a 10 on a scale of 1-5\\n__label__2 a book of great ideas.: This is a very pratical book in my opinion, as one can creat ideas from the simplest thing.\\n__label__1 Too, too much!: I love old, glamourous things, pieces with history and beauty. There are plenty of them in this book, but as a decorating guide, I found it a little too rich for my taste. Some rooms are over the top, and some, to me, are hideous! But taste is a very individual thing. Rachel Ashwell\\'s Shabby Chic books are more my style, I think.\\n__label__2 Very Specific and Lovely Book: I read this book a number of years ago and came across it again when researching a move into a small condo. I agree that it is a wonderful book as the antithesis of potterybarn and restoration hardware living that is enough to kill anyone with an independant idea- and while the author\\'s style is too fussy for me, I love the text and the pace of the book. I would highly recommend it to someone who believes in interior decoration as a theory, a passion, if not a practicality.\\n__label__1 not what I expected: this has been on my want list for a year or more, and I finally found a copy at my library. I am SO glad I didn\\'t buy this. It is way, way too overdone for my taste, and in no way does it reflect any element of french style that I\\'ve seen. I\\'d consider myself a francophile, but even Versailles looks restrained in comparison to Strasser\\'s layers upon layers upon layers. I\\'d hate to clean in any of these rooms. There are some good ideas, like the rinceau treatment of the warehouse room turned parlor, but they were largely hidden under swaths of satin and clutter. I\\'d hoped for more depictions of true french designs.\\n__label__1 Of no value: This book has no interest for someone interested in decorating. Very boring, not enough photos. A real vanity book.\\n__label__2 Great Product: This cream is nourishing, and non-greasy. Love the feel on my skin. No break outs, and my skin absorbed it well.Would recommend this product highly. I have very dry sensitive skin, that\\'s been resurfaced, and it was very compatible with my skin.\\n__label__1 Life imitates art: This book isn\\'t much more than a novelized screenplay -- kind of a \"Cape Fear\" in a political setting -- and I can\\'t recommend it to anyone. But for those questioning its credibility: a state Senate candidate in Tennessee has just been charged with the murder of his opponent, a heavily favored incumbent who was killed on his farm. The parallels pretty much stop there, but it\\'s still eerie.\\n__label__1 Good and Bad: Great CD, terrible DVD. Just buy the CD, The DVD isn\\'t worth using for a coaster. I\\'ve seen better video on cell phones. Oh yea, the audio on the DVD is as bad as the video.\\n__label__1 Only If You Like Disgusting Things: Chew on This by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson is about fast food and how bad it is for you. There are a lot of different stories in the book. One was about schools taking out soda machines and putting in water and healthier drinks, but still having McDonald\\'s and Burger King which is even less healthy.Chew on This was not my favorite book. I am a vegetarian so the meat part made me gag. The book takes a long time to read; it feels like forever. The things that I don\\'t like are when they explain how they kill a chicken and that pink lemonade is really made from bugs. I know that the facts are disgusting, but it is awesome how bugs can turn lemonade pink. The purpose of writing the book is to convince the customers not to eat at fast food restaurants. I suggest that you only read this book if you like reading about disgusting things.Adrienne F.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi\\n__label__1 Not as good as the rest: This compilation, while a decent collection of trance and techno, failed to \"hit the spot\". Unfortunately, the quality seems to be deteriorating. Euphoria II and III were amazing collections. If only they could come back with that same magic.\\n__label__2 Inspiration to begin buying CDs again: Seeing as my CD collection has all but turned into a glorified set of frisbees from the MC hammer craze, I decided to start afresh with Matt Darey\\'s Euphoria Level 4. Although I normally just download the most popular trance and house tunes on MP3, it\\'s the lesser known tracks that fall inbetween that really stand out on a compilation like this. The second CD is my favorite of the two, I recommend tracks 4, 9 and 11 -all of which were discovered while napping on the train to work. I also recommend Darey\\'s Ibiza release within the Euphoria collection.at best: you have a CD with mellow tunes to chill to, and plenty of thumping sets to throw parties withat worst: you\\'ll find a few no-namer DJs with good sound that might be worth checking out on MP3\\n__label__2 Good Compan: This group got my order to me quickly and in one piece which is the only thing they needed to do. I would buy from them a hundred more times.\\n__label__2 Just want to help new mothers-Like other reviews helped me!: I love it and so does my son. I would def. reccomend, but if you have to bring it up a lot of stairs it is pretty heavy especially for the first coulple of month after baby when you are still weak. If Grandma is using it a lot it could be tough to heave into trunk of car.\\n__label__1 Waste of money!: My son saw this advertised on tv and begged for it for Christmas. I looked for it everywhere and finally found one last one on the shelf right before Christmas and thought it was a great score. Wrong! After playing with it for 10 minutes, watching the Alien \"balls\" fizzle like Alka Seltzers til they exposed a couple of cheap, plastic toys, he completely lost interest. The van is poorly constructed and the parts do NOT fit back in, nor does it stay together. Just TRY to store it on a shelf without it falling apart and spilling its contents everywhere. This piece of junk is going right in the give-away bag. And my son won\\'t miss it!\\n__label__1 So NOT worth it: This really ticked me off to find out that I only got one when it clearly says that it\\'s sold as a six pack. If it\\'s possible I want my money back asap. I don\\'t understand why some people are receiving only one and then there are the lucky ones who get all six, something tells me that those reviews are fake.\\n__label__1 Not as advertised: As with many other reviewers of this product, I only got one canvas in the package, not 6. This company either can\\'t count to six, or it has the most expensive single canvas I have ever seen. Amazon\\'s return process made it simple enough to get my money back, but with all of the negative reviews of this product, it is obvious that there is a serious problem with the way the product is described.\\n__label__1 I think it is safe to say that this is F2F\\'s last album.: It\\'s a shame. Now that they\\'ve ruined their credibility, I doubt that they will be able to make a new album under any label. I can\\'t help but think of the skit on Big Choice when they are talking to the record company exec. The irony is delicious!\\n__label__2 Six shooters and damsels in distress: This is one of my favorite albums of all time and by far my favorite Face to Face album. They sound completely different and pull it off nicely. Every song is great and sounds completely unique. \"Heart of Hearts\" and \"Maybe Next Time\" are two songs that when you fight with your woman and need to feel even worse about it, you pop them bad boys in and you\\'re good to go. My favorite song on the album is \"Protocol\". It kicks serious donkey. I\\'ve had this CD for close to 4 years and it hasn\\'t got old yet. Although it is hard to make out thru all of the scratches and battle scars. And it has one of those f*cking sun spots that looks like a kid stood over it with a magnifying glass and burned a hole thru it. I need to get it again. And again if need be. And yes, even again, after it has been mangled 5 or 6 times, I will still get it again. Well, after two times, I\\'ll probably just steal it off of the internet. Thank God for piracy and plundering swashbucklers.\\n__label__1 new album not worth dancing to.: i have seen face to face more times than i can count and each time i loved them and they put on a great show. i didn\\'t think there was a face to face song that i didn\\'t like and everyone was special in its own way. when ever i felt down i would listen to them and it would pick me right back up and make me want to dance. \"ignorance is bliss\" is just to slow. i love the melodies but it sounds good with fast music. the new album is just slow dramatic, nothing like i expected. i am just afraid to see them now because i won\\'t be able to dance to the new stuff. they need to go back to the \"don\\'t turn away\" days and stay true to their fans istead of trying to reach the mainstream with their new album.\\n__label__2 A useful guide for all to love and serve: Gerald Darring has compiled a helpful and thought provoking collection for preachers and every-day Christians that make one to stop and think of the implications for living the the Gospel in the concrete experience of life while broadening the reader\\'s horizons for Gospel living of today. One of the best homily sources I have seen in my study and pastoral pratice. It is a useful resource for prayer and reflection.\\n__label__2 wonderful tiles!: I gave my granddaughter this set just before her third birthday and she loved it! She played with it non-stop all afternoon and the morning of her party, a time when we thought she would be running around burning off steam. Instead, it held her attention, kept her focused and interested. Of course, someone had to be there to help out, three is a bit young to build complicated things, but she was able to do quite a lot on her own, with just a little help from an adult. I recommend this highly.\\n__label__2 FANTASTIC toy for all ages: my husband wanted this toy for our daughter at her one-year birthday, i thought she was too young, but he was right!! these are great for even the smallest hands. they are so easy to stick together, and big enough she could still grab them. now at 2 yrs we got this DX set with the car and other cool pieces, and it\\'s even more fun to build things! we\\'ve built castles for her dolls, tracks for cars and trains, houses, etc - PLUS we have her sort them by color & shape, it can be educational as well as imaginative. highly recommended. as an added bonus, parents have lots of fun with them too!PS- our children\\'s museum has these as well, and i have seen the colors worn off their pieces. So i suppose after a LOT of use the might show some wear, but they still work great so who cares!\\n__label__1 They Call Me Naughty Lola: They Call Me Naughty Lola: Personal Ads from the London Review of Books, edited by David Rose\"They Call Me Naughty Lola\" was recommended to me by a friend, and I normally enjoy British humor, so I thought I\\'d like it. But something about the book was off for me.It just wasn\\'t that funny.The book is nicely put together, with some footnotes for references to British pop culture, but there were some missing references. The acronym WTLM is used in almost every ad, but is never explained. The ads themselves are creative, but I wouldn\\'t consider most of them humorous. I think this book is best in short doses; if you sat down and tried to read it straight through, as I did, the humor dies almost entirely.2/5.\\n__label__2 Very good lens: I had minolta maxxum st si camera and this lens is a perfect match for that silver color camera.\\n__label__1 Buyer Beware - This is a Cheap & Unreliable Unit: This fax worked okay for a few months, then stopped being able to connect to any eFax number - always reports a POOR LINE CONDITION error. Yet, I could turn around and fax the same doc on the same line to a regular fax machine/number a minute later. Seems like this cheap fax machine cant connect to all types of faxes. This unit is also making strange creaking noises now when trying to scan in a doc. It\\'s a cheap unit so buyer beware - you get what you pay for. I am now ordering a new fax machine to replace this one, and this time I am spending a little more money to get a better unit. Bottom line, buy something else.\\n__label__2 You\\'ll Like It.: This item does everything is is supposed to do. It\\'s the perfect Home 3 in 1. Copy quality is good.\\n__label__1 O.K. for a once in a while fax from home: When I needed a fax machine I just went to Amazon, I ought to have checked the local office supply stores. They had lower prices on this item.It\\'s O.K. for the situation where a fax is needed, certainly not for a high volume of work.\\n__label__1 It gets jammed after 6 month use!!!: I use this for home, I don\\'t use much fax usually once or twice a week for my sales application I need to fax in to sign up my clients. I bought this because of its price and size but week after week it starts to jamming up which not only it slows my workflow and frustrating it began to rip my papers or wrinkles them up.Do not buy this unit, it\\'s total crap and worthless. I learned my lesson and will invest more money to buy a reliable fax machine.\\n__label__1 very dissapoinyed by Brother Products: My last Brother fax ( a higher end model) just stopped working. Can\\'t find anyonme to work on these so you throw it away and buy a new one. I thought I would stay simple and bought a 575 but it jams continually and my biggest problem is only 1 out of 10 faxes sent goes through, it keeps disconnecting. My phone company says they have compatability problems with Brother (Verizon) so I am returning this for a higher end model again. I guess you get what you pay for. Don\\'t buy this or any Brother product!!!!!\\n__label__2 Stand by: We purchased this as kind of a back up for when and if we need a fax. Not used often, But to date, it has worked fine. Have been pleased with all purchases from Amazon, hope the service continues.\\n__label__2 for home offices, Perfect.: Finding this fax/phone for under $30 made it a \\'must have\\'. It\\'s easy to set up, has all the features I need and more for home convenience. It\\'s small, lightweight (without being flimsy) and for the dozen or so times I\\'ll need it a year, I won\\'t have to pull out the manual every time as it\\'s quite simple to operate. I\\'m real happy with it.\\n__label__1 poor choice: This machine is a poor example of fax machine its alignment is bad its copys are bad it has a ink tape which was not explained, I know this is a cheap machine but many things are inexpensive but is no excuse poor workmanship.Thank You Carl WilliamsPS This is why I am returning this product.\\n__label__2 Good for home use: I\\'ve had this fax machine for a couple of years. I don\\'t use it a lot, a couple of times a month on average, and only for sending out. I have received a few faxes and it\\'s okay, tho the printing quality isn\\'t real good...just okay. I wouldn\\'t recommend this fax machine for business use, but if you\\'re like me and just need to fax out now and then from home, it\\'s perfect.\\n__label__2 Best Fax Ever!: Okay, I bought this fax machine to replace an old dinosaur fax I had since forever!! Hands down, this was the best minimal investment I ever made. I don\\'t know how I lived without this handy little workhorse! It sends and recieves faces and it also makes black and white photocopies. I paid less than $30 dollars for this Brother 575 Fax and that included shipping. It came with ink pre installed and works beautifully. A real bargain!!\\n__label__1 PCM Stereo Sound is too bad: The video footage is ok although the cuts between the different sets are too rough. You don`t get the impression to be on one concert you will think this is more a DVD with Hector`s music videos all lined up. But the worst think is the sound. No Bass at all. I got a 5.1 sourround system but the PCM Stereo sound on this DVD is too bad. When you have an old TV and the complete sound comes out of it, you may don`t have a problem with the sound. But I do! How can someone who owns millions and gives an expensiv concert, release the DVD in such a horrible sound? Wisin y Yandel released their tomando control Live DVD in 5.1 sound.\\n__label__1 Cheap: Cheap, non wicking. It\\'s simply a cap with air holes; almost meaningless. SInce it\\'s too big (OSFA) it\\'s floppy; looks ridiculous. If you\\'ve got a big head & lots of hair maybe you can wear ity under a helmet.\\n__label__1 Unacceptable for road bikes: Caution, be aware this product requires you to REPLACE the skewer with their cheap supplied skewer. If you have invested in all high end components, this is not acceptable. Otherwise, you will be completely rebuilding your ride between indoor and outdoor (better not hope you get invited to a group ride the same day your bike is mounted on this piece of crap). Look for equipment that is more flexible in adjustment so that you truly have a quick in and out of the trainer.\\n__label__2 Great product: My husband and I each have a trainer and we think they are great. They do need a bit of tweaking to get them just right and you can\\'t coast but they still make for a great work out. Some mornings are too cold and too dark to ride outside and I find the trainer to be a great safe alternative. This product is our first trainer and I doubt we will be needed another.\\n__label__2 mahjong: I love buying at amazon for the products they sell and come on time, great job I myself says. Now this game is fun if your a mahjong player like I am so everyone you\\'ll like it like I have and beat it too.\\n__label__1 un- happy: The sword was well packed for shipping. The grip was loose and the sword was stuck in the scabberd. I thought it was rusted. To remove it I removed the grip and with a pair of pliers and hammer I was able to remove it. No rust. The blade was to wide for the scabberd and I was unable to replace it. I recommend buying a better quality sword.\\n__label__2 Gundam Wing Ground Zero: This is so cool!I read it on the internet and I had to buy it after that!If ya like Gundam Wing you should realy get this!It\\'s awesome!!\\n__label__1 Shell shucked: I can\\'t believe how long it\\'s taking this company to ship this order. I think if I started shelling the sunflowers myself, I would shell 20 lbs before this order arrived. I feel shucked over! I would definately cancel this if I could.\\n__label__2 My birds are satisfied: I\\'ve ordered this product six times so far.. due to reasonable price, free shipping and convenience of big bag. So far the quality is good. Birds love it. Each time I make my own mix of birdfood, I drool over the sunflower hearts and crave to make a salad for myself with sunflower seeds sprinkle over it (no, I didn\\'t eat my bird\\'s sunflower hearts), but just want to say how good this product\\'s quality is that its makes me want some too! :)\\n__label__2 Lenox Holiday China: The China is beautiful. The price was great and it was packaged nicely.No damage in shipping. It arrived quickly and I was delighted with the purchase. Hope the sale is repeated next year so I can add to my collection.\\n__label__1 Incomplete Guide: Very incomplete guide, only few selected climbs in each area. If general info is what you seek, the guidebook is OK. If you need a comprehensive guide to all the climbs, it would be better to purchase guidebook locally.\\n__label__2 Great little camera: This camera is easy to use. Only needed instructions on setting date. Film loaded easily. Compact and fun. Great camera for the price.\\n__label__2 Rilke Songs, et al.: A very pleasant album, well performed. We especially enjoyed the songs, and the outstanding voice of Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, tragically, taken from us far too soon.\\n__label__1 Rip-off drum: For $5-$10 more than the cost of this drum, you can buy a brand new Brother HL-2070n printer, which includes not only this drum, but also:1. a new 2,000 page toner cartridge (although you have to follow instructions freely available on the Internet to keep the toner cartridge from shutting down after 1,000 pages.)2. a spare printer for free.\\n__label__1 a business trickery: Brother printers may be cheap, but the drum units for them are not. This is a classic business trickery. They tease you with a cheap first buy. Then you have no choice but to continue buy the expensive parts. Furthermore, the quality of the drum is not good either. The company says that one drum unit can be used for 12,000 pages assuming 5% coverage. This is not true. The drum unit replaced with the original one in my printer had problems far before printing that number of pages based on 5% coverage.\\n__label__2 Exactly what we needed at a good price: Unfortunately, our printer is now in need of other repairs and we are unable to take advantage of using our purchase.\\n__label__2 Not bad for a boot, but way overpriced & should be free: I always get steamed seeing somebody making money off of a boot that you can easily get for free. If you are making money off of the show, I suggest you pay the Marley estate their share, otherwise share it freely, \\'cause it ain\\'t copyrighted.If you want it for free, just google \"Bob Marley Quiet Knight flac\".I suggest that Amazon no longer carry this product.\\n__label__2 A must have CD!!: As an amateur pianist I only listen to classical music casually, so I\\'m no expert on the great soloists of the violin. However when I originally saw Hilary playing on a local public TV station that runs a program that plays various classical music videos. A little promotional/documentary about this CD was playing and I was simply entranced by the music I heard. Becoming an instant \"fan\" I bought 4 of her albums, and this one I believe is head and shoulders above the rest. I don\\'t know if it\\'s simply the selections of music by Bach or her obvious mastery of the violin that make this CD such a joy to listen to for me. All I know is that I can\\'t wait to hear more recordings from this great musician!\\n__label__1 Disappointing: I heard Hilary Hahn live, here in the Netherlands and I was stunned by the performance. She played Bach, the second Partita. It was amazing. I was looking forward to listen to her Bach violin concertos. But when I heard them, I was really disappointed. She plays them technically perfect, but this is not what I heard in the music hall. Her violin concertos are not inspiring. They have no soul, no meaning. I wish she played them like she plays the Bach partitas.A dissapointed Dutchmen\\n__label__2 very beautiful: If you are looking for a beautiful easy to listen to performance of bach this is a great recording. If you are looking for a recording of a performer who pays attention to performance practice of baroque era music you will be disappointed. Vibrato is used throughout and the ornamentation leaves something to be desired. All said though, this is a beautiful recording that I enjoy even though I know that it is not as Bach would have wanted it played.\\n__label__1 A Misstep: I have loved every previous Hilary Hahn recording, and given them all 5 stars. This one is a distinct misstep. It is just too fast. I felt like punching my cd player to slow it down! The playing is brittle, lacking in character (except for one of ths slow movements), and wholly without interest. Had I heard this recording blind, I never would have thought this was Hilary Hahn. Such a shame.\\n__label__1 A self-published, 156 page novel: \\'nuff said?: The first 5 reviewers here are obviously the best friends of Margaret Doner! This is a skimpy foray into too deep waters for a beginner. Have you ever read a good Tudor biography that was only 156 pages long? Can you imagine that there are any significant facts, details, insights in so few pages? Well, you\\'re right--there aren\\'t! What we do have are stereotypes (dirty old king, lusty Chaucerian wench, stupid courtiers, etc.). What is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how Catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes, how they could behave as if there had never been an Anne Bolyn: that\\'s the mystery that has always fascinated me about Henry\\'s \"rose without thorns,\" but you\\'ll find no answers here. Please save your money, your time, and be a bit more patient. Eventually, someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about Catherine Howard.\\n__label__1 Colored hair a bluish tint: I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years. The shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple. Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn\\'t notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so. I, of course, don\\'t know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.David T.\\n__label__2 Seek to See Him: It is most probable that the Valentinians, like the Manichaeans and the Naassenes, at least were acquainted with Thomas and incorporated some of its traditions into their works perhaps because it contains a negative world view and stresses \"knowledge\" as part of its soteriological scheme.But gnostic use does not predicate gnostic origins. We should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in Thomas into Gnosticism, not the influx of Gnosticism into Thomas. The future of research on possible connections between the Gospel of Thomas and Gnosticism should be moving in the direction of exploring the influences that this non-gnostic Gospel\\'s ideology may have had on emerging second century gnostic systems.\\n__label__1 HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT...DON\\'T BUY THIS BOOK: Up until I found out about Dr. Schwartz endorsing the female medium (not Ms. DuBois) of which many of these reviews are speaking, I would have said that his work was authentic and very beneficial to the field of mediumship. I am incredibly disappointed that he would include this person on his list of reputable and respected mediums, as this person is merely an actress, nothing more. She is preying on people who are grieving; using them for her own personal gain. Dr. Schwartz, you have done the public at large a great disservice, and I no longer have any desire to read your work.[...]\\n__label__1 Phallic Narcissism at it\\'s finest....: Gary Schwartz writes like a classic Phallic Narcissist, a clinical term used to describe people who elicit his type of behavior.Isn\\'t it curious how he espouses over and over again being a \"clinical psychologist\", when in fact it is a LIE. Anyone who would lie about their credentials, would lie about their results in research....don\\'t believe the hype.....\\n__label__1 Not sure what I was expecting when I chose this book.: This book was about the scientific testing of Allison Dubois. I know it says that on the cover but it seemed more like a brag book. That\\'s only my opinion. It might seem wonderful to someone else but came across as almost self serving to me.\\n__label__1 how many sock puppets does it take????: should be the opening line of a bad joke, but when someone MENTIONED in the book, maligns the SUBJECT of the book, while hiding behind the sweetness and light moniker ASKSPIRIT, me thinks something smells rotten in stinkville.pee-u!!!!\\n__label__1 Cat got his tongue?: I felt the same way about the authors use of a cat metaphor to discribe gifted research mediums....too bad, if anyone could raise the bar on this profession, I thought someone with his credentials could do so, but I guess not.Cat got their tongue? Why no opinion on their website?\\n__label__1 The Truth About THE TRUTH ABOUT MEDIUM: This book promises the extraordinary, including specific data from science experiments, but what we get are more anecdotes about how great Mr. Schwartz\\'s experiments are. He features highlights of experiments with medium Allison DuBois, but Schwartz\\' bias in favor of his subject matter makes this book an epiphany of self-celebration. There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn\\'t it published in Science Magazine? Talk of \"Replication and Extension Reading\" is confined to Mr. Schwartz\\'s \"Lab,\" and we\\'re left wondering if any of Schwartz\\'s experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities. Why sacrifice scientific method for sensational tidbits? Oh, yeah! The book\\'s release coincides exactly with the new fall TV season of MEDIUM.\\n__label__1 Ugh: This was the worst book I\\'ve read in a long time. No \"truth\" was revealed in this sloppily edited (if at all) book that was obviously just written in a hurry to cash in on the show Medium\\'s success. Confusing, poorly written text. I learned nothing. Don\\'t waste your time or money on this one. Ugh.\\n__label__1 She\\'s not Mongolian or Native Siberian: The author has adopted a Mongolian name but she is NOT Mongolian. Neither is she one of the native Siberian peoples.Tread cautiously - I thought her first book was terrible and self-serving. Like a \"recipe\" book with no rhyme or reason. Like all stories written by people who have \"gone native\" you really need to take this with a grain of salt.\\n__label__1 NO GOOD: Do not waste money and time reading this book. Stuff like this ( and recently \\'The Secret\\') there are no other thing that new ways to some \\'authors\\' to make a lot of money based in people\\'s ingenuousness...\\n__label__1 From the author of Tales of Ancient Xenar: Yes, my review here isn\\'t for this book, but for the author and the techniques he teaches. I have read a lot of Mr. Losier\\'s works about the law of attraction and his works detail a lot of work to make it work in your favor. He has you writing out whole lists of thing you want and don\\'t want, these list called Clarity/Contrast lists. I frankly don\\'t like having to write pages of lists just to make something work for me. My advice to all of you, avoid stuff by Michael Losier.\\n__label__2 Law of attraction: This book has changed my understanding of how to attract what I want and to eliminate more of what I don\\'t. When things don\\'t fit my vibration, I immediately make adjustments. I have totally taken charge of how I view the world. INCREDIBLE!!!\\n__label__1 This is not a law. This is not science.: I can\\'t believe people fall for this garbage. The ideas presented in this book are done so without any regard to scientific method, and \"The Law of Attraction\" is far from a law. Laws are absolute. Laws are proven. Laws are backed up by fact. Show me the proof that our bodies operate at a particular \"vibration\" and it is this vibration that either attracts or repels things in our lives. This book does not offer that proof, and neither can you. Sorry, finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground is not proof that our bodies are \"vibrating\" or that finding that ticket was based on positive thinking.Be careful of any writing that proclaims something a \"Universal Law\" that clearly isn\\'t.Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m a big proponent of positive thinking and I feel it is helpful. But the author is stealing your money by selling you false claims, fantasies, and untruths.Why would you spend your hard-earned money on a lie?\\n__label__2 Simple, fast way to change your thinking: This book is for the \"terrible two\\'s\" child within us. \"I don\\'t like this, I don\\'t like that!\" It forces you to ask the simple question...\"Well what do you want?\" Amazingly, adults may need to be reminded to of this. The book goes on to develop techniques to answer the question and implement solutions. As others have written, may not be a major revelation, but the author provides a reminder to discipline the inner child in straightforward manner that will get results.\\n__label__2 A Book to Succeed in Writing: Excellent book to help you achieve success in all areas of your life. Get the principles shown here, apply them and get the sucess you want. Recommended.\\n__label__1 dissappointed: I do believe the Audio CD would have been way better if narrated by Mike Losier himself. Instead, you hear Hugh Gallager\\'s narration which is monotone and lacking inspiration. So dissappointed in his choice of narration, I would probably reccomend buying the book instead.\\n__label__2 Positive Read: A positive read to help you attract the things in life that make you happy and not drag you down.Great advice and inspirational read!\\n__label__1 A whole book for one simple concept!: I thought the book was way too basic. There were many exercises that you had to do and write about in the book. I thought most of it was there simply to fill up space since the main idea could be explained on one page. I am giving it two stars instead of one because after all, the author did try to write a book explaining how the Law of Attraction works. Two of my favorite books talking about the Law of Attraction are \"Ask and It Is Given\" by E. Hicks and \"How To Be Wildly Wealthy Fast\" by S. Forster.\\n__label__2 A Simple Clear Guide to Manifestation: I really enjoyed this book because it was brief, direct, concrete and offered clear worksheets that you could personalize (for yourself or for coaching clients). I think the inner work of changing your beliefs and vibration is very important in manifestation. The one thing I would have liked included was an emphasis on action as well-ie: \\'I am a famous actor AND I am actively applying for auditions.\\' Many Law of Attraction books seem to leave out this action part.\\n__label__2 Everything you need to know!: This is an excellent book. Very clear and easy to understand, yet loaded with relevant information. It\\'s my new favorite!\\n__label__2 A Great Book for Both Begainner: This is one of the best orchid encyclopedia i had seen so far! Many species are described, both commonly grown and popular ones to unknowns. The book cover wide range of genus and species esp. with genus with fewer number of species. The only set back is, it didn\\'t cover fully enough on certain family, esp. my favorite ones such as, Dendrobium, Vanda, Renanthera, and Cymbidium as lots of species seen to be missing in the encyclopedia. Never theless, this is a great book and strongly recommanded for everyone; with many reference to the photos.\\n__label__2 AMAZING!!: Very informative! Colorful & interesting. Anyone could raise orchids with this book. It makes it easy...\\n__label__2 Colton\\'s Review: I purchased this product for my 11-year old son. Amazon had it when it was nowhere else to be found. It was delivered to our home within 3 days. Thank you Amazon!\\n__label__1 Bumblebee Transformer DON\"T WASTE YOUR $$$$, it\\'s crap!!: I was under the impression that the price meant better quaility and durablilty, but with this product that was untrue. The simaliar bumblebee transformer was at WalMart for $10.00 that was the same quality and durability. My son recieved this toy on Christmas day, it is now the 28th of December and the head has already fallen of 5 times, the door has come off twice. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!! I wish I could get my money back for this piece of CRAP!!\\n__label__2 Call me Ichabod: I gave this to my 5-year-old nephew for his birthday. He freaked out \"the best gift ever!!! I love you Aunt Jill!\" Exactly the reaction you hope for when you give a kid a gift. Three days later my nephew called to inform me that, sadly, Bumblebee had been decapitated. But he still called it \"the best gift ever!!!\" So, I guess Bumblebee doesn\\'t really need a head to be fun.\\n__label__1 average at best: there aren\\'t alot of cuts here that I dig on a whole but a Cut like \"Move your Body\" is a fun jam. truth is most of these Acts belong on this kind of Compilation because to have to sit through a whole disc of there stuff would put you to sleep.I can see the appeal of these type of compilations because as I\\'ve said before some of these Acts at best are looking at 3-4 song Careers at most.\\n__label__1 Not this one...: Id just like to know how to get a refund? The remote worked golden for the first set of batteries when they went dead though all the keys froze to completely different settings and when I replaced the batteries and tried to reprogram it, its officially broken!\\n__label__1 Read ads very closely: Well I am really thankful I read all of the reviews and noticed this price was for 1 bowl only. That is insane. Wal-mart carries the Corelle line of dishes and you can buy those bowls there for a couple of dollars a piece. I am surprised Amazon allows dealers to rip people off like that. I have always bragged about Amazon to my friends and recommended them to everyone. Good to know they do not always make their vendors do the right thing.I\\'ll keep that in mind when shopping here and read all the fine print\\n__label__2 Great plates!: These plates are great - they don\\'t chip or break and wash easily. These smaller plates are especially good for portion control. I\\'ve got a whole set and would readily buy more. These are also good for little hands that like to drop things :-)\\n__label__1 Just another crappy CD made quickly to rob you: Este disco se debe de aver tomado uno o dos dias para grabar. Solo es algo que isieron rapidamente para que la gente lo comprara despues del NO merecido exito de DOS LOCOS. No gasten su dinero paisas, por favor, esto es basura. Solo miren la portada y se daran cuenta!\\n__label__2 love it! perfect size for aspiring artists: love this size and brand. winsor makes great canvases. the size is great for aspiring artist because its big enough to actually work with but not so big that you\\'ll have extra space, use a lot of paint, or will have a problem hanging it. also great because if you sell your work its perfect size and keeps costs low so that your work will actually sell.shipped fast, great price, was as expected.\\n__label__1 IS-20 , bad pictures: I\\'ve been using this camera for about 4 mos. already upgrading from a point/shoot olympus clamshell camera and was very much dissappointed with the quality of the pictures,. It definitely looks cool but the output was terrible, overexposure, dark backgrounds. I tried auto mode and manual mode. Can\\'t say more but I am definitely not recommending this camera.\\n__label__2 Auto camera with manual preciseness: I\\'ve had a manual-focus camera for years, set apertures, speeds, etc. This camera gives you all the exactness of that medium with the total convenience and ease of a fully automatic package. Plus you can set your own apertures if you wish to move \"outside the box\" and the camera sets the speed for you! The settings are easy to figure out, auto focusing is a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it, there\\'s nothing easier. Great versatility in a reasonably priced package! I highly recommend it.\\n__label__2 Lenox China: I purchased this to give as a gift. The product is exactly what I expected and I got a great price.\\n__label__1 Five stars for Cynthia Rylant: I suggest Cynthia Rylant\\'s Henry and Mudge books to every little grandchild that love to read or be read to. My granddaughter loves all Cynthia\\'s stories. Every book is new adventure.........\\n__label__2 Azure Bonds: Action, magic, intrigue, qualities I like in a novel. All of that and more were included in this interesting story.\\n__label__2 good story, well-written, pleasant summer reading: recommended, pleasant summer reading. good story, well-written, nicely told. donna huston murray has a fine touch with her pen.\\n__label__2 More short, simple, and readable Potato Chip editorials.: Once again the texts of several of Charles Colson\\'s BreakPoint radio commentaries are collected into the book format. As with A Dance with Deception, which I finished a short while ago, the short editorials focusing on the difficulties with maintaining a fundamental Christian world view in a seeming increasingly harsh and anti-Christian world are readable and, more importantly, thought provoking. Recommended.\\n__label__2 good, but not as good as the first two: I really liked this book, but I thought that the first two of the trilogy were better. I didn\\'t really like the ending or the deaths of some of the characters, but all in all, a good book.\\n__label__1 If you\\'re looking for a graphic novel, keep looking.: I\\'m sorry I was looking for something with a little more art. This isn\\'t the first comic to cross over into novel form, too bad amazon shopers can\\'t actually see the merchandise they are buying. The description of the book is a little ambiguous. It may be a well written book, but I was looking for graphic novels and this did mention that there were illustrators for the novel. I wish I knew that there would only be a few illustrated pages.\\n__label__2 Helping your child understand how things work: While the information in this book is somewhat dated (published in 1971) it contains good cut-away pictures and explanantions of basic everyday methods of transportation (boats, planes, cars) as well as telephones, rockets, etc. that are easy to understand for the younger child (not toddler). My children thoroughly enjoyed this book when they were growing up and I am replacing their worn-out copy for my grandson who is also enjoying it.\\n__label__2 He\\'s the best: I have bought the entire Paul Check physio-ball video series. I also have videos from other instructors and Paul\\'s are by far the best. He knows the body so well and explains how and why to do things so you can understand. I feel scientifically grounded in my knowledge. I teach a weekly class on the physio-ball and have incorporated everything I learned from this and the first video (Exercises for Abs and Buns). Be ready for a challenging workout!\\n__label__1 Not What I Thought: I felt that I was misled. I was under the impression that this was the original soundtrack. It was not. :(\\n__label__2 Awesome: What a great group of musicians, I have been a fan since I first heard about them while I was still working in radio.\\n__label__2 Awesome recipes: Awesome recipes. Quite a bit of soy used in a lot of the receipes though but great recipes nevertheless. Makes lo carb fun and easy.\\n__label__2 Great addition to Protein Power: The regular hamburgers and grilled meat was getting old. I tried this and got some low carb breads and sweets. I think that I can stick to the diet now. The recipes that I have tried so far have been good.\\n__label__2 You must pick this up!: I\\'m a third-year medical student, and I\\'ve been worrying for some time now about how I\\'d decide what specialty to go into. Of course, nothing substitutes for some good, old-fashioned soul-searching, but Dr. Freeman\\'s book will certainly kick your inner dialogue into gear.What impressed me most about this book was the quality of information--everything was accurate, up-to-date, and written in an engaging way. I learned many things about each of the specialties I am consdering that I\\'d never read anywhere else. I also appreciated the fact that each specialty chapter is written by someone who\\'s actually \"been there, done that\"--they\\'re all written by residents.Overall, I highly recommend this book to any medical student who is pondering what specialty to choose.\\n__label__2 Very useful for the application-oriented: If your primary interest is in writing compression algorithms, this is the book you want. It does a fine job of explaining several different techniques, and shows you how to implement them.It\\'s light on the theory side, so if you\\'re more interesting in the \"why\" than the \"what\", you may want to choose a different book. One exception to this is the explanation of arithmetic coding and statistical methods, which can actually be read and understood in one pass.\\n__label__1 Sounds like a typical movie soundtrack album...: I admit it. I read all the extremely positive reviews, and was duped into thinking that this album was somehow set apart from all other movie soundtracks. So, I ran out, and purchased it. However, after listening to it, I was truly disappointed. There is nothing striking or significant about this piece. The movie is outstanding, and the music within the movie context is fitting. However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same. To sum it up in one word...boring. Now, if your interested in powerful, moving music that stands apart, might I suggest the Schindler\\'s List Soundtrack...the violin solos by Itzhak Perlman are truly outstanding.\\n__label__1 Disappointing: I ordered this movie going off the other reviewers on Amazon and boy was I wrong. It was long, cheesy and just pure uninteresting. The casting was done well and Hritik and Sanjay really played their parts but that was the only saving grace.There was a song and dance number every-time you turned around. While they were mediocre in nature, they did not help advance the story line in any shape or form. The story itself is far fetched and is not fathomable by any stretch.\\n__label__1 Fram is poor quality: The standard Fram oil filters are considered one of the poorest quality oil filters on the market. They have cardboard internal end caps and irregular filter medium held together by clips. These are constructed in Canada and quality control doesn\\'t seem all that good. As someone else mentioned, go to YouTube and look up \"oil filter comparisons\" - you\\'ll see how inferior Fram is compared to other brands. I used Fram for years, but will not buy any more after seeing these dramatic comparisons!\\n__label__2 This is a WONDERFUL BOOK!: It is a replacement copy for the 1st one I had! It arrived in good condition within the delivery window! I am very happy to have it again! Thank You!\\n__label__2 Excellent behind the scenes shots: This is a great addendum to the Dune miniseries on the Sci-Fi channel. I thoroughly enjoyed the color section in the middle of the book and reading about the director and production of the expensive series. The DVD that came with it was fun but long winded at times when the interviewees went into what they \\'believed\\' to be Frank Herbert\\'s desires. But how could they know? Anyway, a good book for the Dune fan to pick up.\\n__label__1 Very poor logic and writing ability: This book and the authors\\' approach to the subject is extremely elemental. He clearly is not too intelligent or does not have much to say.\\n__label__1 If you are Italian DO NOT READ THIS BOOK: Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common) Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment.So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring.\\n__label__1 painful: Full of painfully obvious cliches. I was insulted on so many levels I don\\'t know where to begin.Save yourself the pain, run don\\'t walk.\\n__label__1 Awful read: This book was a waste of time. American Beauty was a far superior read. I know this was Evelyn Nesbit\\'s memoirs but it was hard to follow [as it was badly written] and very disjointed.\\n__label__1 OK for surfing the internet but if you want to stream or download anything forget it: If all you want to do is surf the internet or check e-mail it\\'s probably fine. If you ever need to download something wrap the adapter in ice first because after 50 Mb or so it will overheat and kill your connection.\\n__label__1 DOES NOT WORK WITH PS3!!: I recently purchased this product with the expectation that I would be able to plug in the adapter and instantly use my Guitar Hero guitars. This was not the case. When I got the adapters, the first thing I noticed was the packaging which stated the product was a \"PS2 to USB (PC)\" adapter. The PS3 has USB ports so I thought this wouldn\\'t be a problem. However, upon plugging the adapter in, I found it wouldn\\'t register the guitars. After further investigation and several minutes of frustration, I noticed a disc included in the packaging marked \"Drivers\". Obviously this presented a problem as the drivers had to be loaded in order to use the adapters. As I haven\\'t yet found a way to load drivers in to the programming of the PS3, I was unable to use the adapters with the console. Bottom line: Don\\'t buy these adapters for use with you PS3. There are adapters out there that are specifically made for the PS3 and work for that application.\\n__label__1 DOES NOT WORK WITH GH3!!: We had one of these adapters anyway and just bought Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock yesterday. The adapter does not work with this game. The PS button brings up the console screen, but no scrolling is possible and it takes control away from any other guitar connected. If you can actually get it into gameplay, the symptoms are similar to those experienced with other Guitar Hero games (no star power deployment using tilt, etc.). DON\\'T BUY THIS if you want to play Guitar Hero on PS3; suck it up and get the new wireless guitar(s) made for the system.\\n__label__1 gives you a short burst of energy: i have been taking this and have lost no weight at alli am alert for a whilei have never been one to eat much at all so appetite was not the problem just gained weight stomach etc for no reason i exercise on a machine i\\'m on less than 1000 calorie diet healthy foods still weight is herei give it to stars because with that short burst of energy at least i get a little bit of work done around the house good luck peoplemy normal weight 120 lbs out of the blue got up to 151 no reason i work out on exercise machine tells u how many fat cals you burn have to burn those first to get rid of the real fat so if you find something that will get rid of belly fat let me know cause i eat very little take these pills and nothing\\n__label__2 Two of the best albums on one Disc!: These two albums \"A Lot to Fear,\" and \"Plant a Tree or Die,\" are the first efforts (and arguably the best), from the environmentally active Boston Hardcore band TREE. The sound is heavy and raw, the breakdowns are clever, the lyrics thought provoking and energized. In their heyday TREE toured with Clutch. One listen to this disc and you\\'ll see why. It\\'ll leave you nodding your head long after the last track ends.\\n__label__1 Why I was dissapointed in this product.: I bought this for my child because it combined a craft like project and gardening. I was very disspointed to find that you cannot use the markers or the paint provided in any way with this, as the tray it comes with is plastic and just comes off. It comes with many seeds, however only enough soil pellets to plant 8-10 seedlings. This just frustrated us more. I would not recommend this item.\\n__label__1 i was sent wrong bracket by seller: yes, i know my review is really late, but i just now tried to install this bracket...i had originally bought it nearly a year ago, but never got around to installing it, as i didn\\'t feel like removing hosing from tankless water heater...but today, during yearly maintenance i tried to install it, and found it didn\\'t fit, i was sent the wrong bracket, i was very disappointed...\\n__label__2 OH WOW!!: We got the recipe and a wonderful book to read every Christmas to remind you what is important. Esther\\'s Gift is very short but the perfect book to get you in the mood for Christmas. I will remember to read it every year!\\n__label__1 Using ASP.NET, a Bit: What a disappoitment!...this book is full of errors. I\\'m not talking of trivial errors either, but of the jaw-dropping variety. For instance, in chapter 7, the author keeps referring to the web.config file as \"config.web\". Additionally, I\\'ve already come across several other major errors in the code examples, more than found in the online errata section. I guess listing them all would be too embarrassing!Sure, the book is an easy read. It\\'s an easy read because it\\'s neither in-depth, nor detailed. Often, a lot of concepts in the code examples are never explained properly.Using ASP.NET??? If you use this book, the errors and the lack of in-depth coverage will leave you dazed, you will end up with more questions than answers, and you will soon be looking for a better book to help you learn ASP.NET in earnest.\\n__label__2 A nice package all around: This is really a very nice collection of love songs from Elvis. I wish the tracking order had been in chronoligcal order by year, but otherwise I\\'m very happy with the collection. I purchased it for the unreleased studio version of \"For The Good Times\" which is nice, but in my opinion does not come close to the live version on the Madison Square Garden album. For those that are new to Elvis thanks to the #1 hits and 2nd To None collections this will be a great way to hear a little of the different styles of music Elvis was capable of. I do have to say that \"Unchained Melody\" is a stand out on here as every Elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him, but the voice was stronger than ever. Sure Elvis fans will have these songs in their collections already, but the remastering job by Vic Anesini is stellar and it brings new life to these classics and will not disappoint.\\n__label__2 This book is GREAT!: It has been a long time since I read a book that I enjoyed so thoroughly. Part European travelogue, Buruma travels from Voltaire\\'s home in Ferney, to Germany, to Holland, and to Great Britain; part philosophical reflection, part history, and part autobiography, Buruma ties together all the strands in a perfectly beautiful bow. Wonderfully written, with unforgettable profiles of major historical and literary figures. \"Laughter is Forbidden!\" announced the Germans as they produced Shakespeare\\'s plays -- but laughter, tears, and insights are the inevitable outcome of a few hours curled up with \"Anglomania: A European Love Affair.\"\\n__label__1 Five really bad games and one that\\'s pretty good: Most of the games in this pack are either terrible or won\\'t run on your PC. The only one that is any good is Sim Golf, and you can get that separately. The other five games combined aren\\'t worth a dollar, several of them wouldn\\'t even run on either of my computers because they have such compatability issues with Windows.\\n__label__1 Not that much good: Well .Not that much ,what I am except ,Not cheap .Not big ,Very normal oil ,Better looking at some where else\\n__label__2 Porsche Fan: As a long time fan and witness to many 956/962 racing wins, and one who has met some of the drivers mentioned in this book, I highly recommend this book to Porsche racing fans. One of the surprising aspects of the book is its insights into the personalities and technologies that played out during their dominance of this era. Very insightful and informative, lots of quotes from drivers, engineers, CEO\\'s and designers too. Many color pictures adds to the enjoyment !\\n__label__2 Fun!: My baby got this for his 1st birthday and really loves it! It is bright and eyecatching and sits just right in the corner of our deck. The lid is easy to put on and off and nice and light, although does not blow off in the wind. It holds at least 4 bags of play sand from Home Depot and could easily hold more. It can hold 3 toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far! The one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby, they have now dented badly...and i am not hugely heavy either! There was no mention of not sitting on it, so i had thought it would be durable enough. This isn\\'t to put anyone off from buying this sandbox..just don\\'t perch on the end of it!\\n__label__2 Crabbie Sandbox: I have purchased this sandbox for my boys (2 1/2 years and 5 years old). They just love it and can not get enough of playing in it. I put 2 50-pound bags of playsand in it and that is sufficient for them.\\n__label__1 HOOT: MY daughter really wanted this movie and it was scratched very badly, I was disappointed that her Christmas gift was such poor quality\\n__label__1 Sorry, But...: In the fifth grade, our teachers showed this movie to us on DVD as a special activity in celebration of Valentine\\'s Day. I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it\\'s just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I\\'ve offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote \"Hoot\" if this review has or would offend him. It just didn\\'t interest me, I am verry sorry to say.\\n__label__2 Hoot - the movie: It\\'s a great movie. I would also suggest reading the book. My 8th graders had to read it for school. I would recommend to anyone of any age. It is a story about a boy who moves to Florida who meets some interesting people.\\n__label__1 No respect for Dads - not like the book at all: In the book the dad is an intelligent, supportive figure - it is he who reviews the building department file and discovers a key to stopping construction. In the movie they give the credit for this completely to the son. In the movie the father is a less-than-supportive stereotyped authority figure who isn\\'t all that bright. Typical Hollywood - put down the father figure at every opportunity.\\n__label__2 Matt\\'s the best: Matt worked on several shoots for me while he was assisting one of the top photographers in the country. Matt\\'s knowledge of his craft was exceptional. He was the consummate professional in every aspect. One of his finest qualities was to be tireless, or appear to be while on the job. Working long hours, he never complained about the ridiculous tasks being asked of him and always offering suggestions on how to improve a shot. Every assistant could learn something good from this remarkable person.\\n__label__2 Innocents Abroad: On a recent cruise in the Mediterranean, I was told by guides and fellow travelers that Mark Twain\\'s Innocents Abroad was a must to read. Twain is always a treat to read and the parallels between his travels and travails and those of a 21st century tourist are striking. Would recommend for any before or during a European tour - especially one on water.\\n__label__1 steering wheel: This shot was garbage it came with missing parts ring color scratched and beat up the worst thing I have ever paid for bitch face fungi chicken wings and booty swet.\\n__label__1 not a sturdy wheel: just bought one of these wheels. had no problem installing software. after one day, the power cord does work anymore. no power to the wheel or pedals, gonna have to take the wheel back now. not going to get another one.\\n__label__2 Great Bokken: I am in no way an experienced swordsman, but I feel that this bokken is great. It is considerably lighter than an actual katana, but I think most bokkens are that way. It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible. Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don\\'t ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons. This is not really an issue unless you decide to channel musashi and fight a katana with a bokken.\\n__label__2 Bokken: Great and tough Cold Steel makes great products, but it is a little on the light side for a good work out.\\n__label__2 Wonderfully told story of coming of age: Lesley does a great job describing the awareness of Culver as he meets challenges growing up without a father. Culver\\'s mother is a strong influence on the boy, but the real character he tries to emulate is his uncle who is a real outdoor\\'s man. I have enjoyed all of Lesley\\'s books and this one was also very good.\\n__label__1 Not near as good as the 6 X 8 in. size: These are at best OK they dry out super fast! You can barely get your hands wiped before the wipe has totally dried out.\\n__label__2 wonderful: I bought these to put in my twin 5 year old boys\\' school lunches. I love the fact that they really use them even when I\\'m not there, they remind me if I ever forget to put one in their lunch.\\n__label__2 Most recent Calphalon Purchase: This set is great as is all the other Calphalon products I\\'ve ordered from Amazon.\\n__label__1 Very disappointed: I am very disappointed in this product. Yes, it tells time, it\\'s compact, it\\'s cute and it has different display colors. But after only a couple months, the alarm stopped going off. On the display, you can see the blinking \"buzz\", but without sound alarm.\\n__label__2 Pretty Nice Alarm Clock: This is a really nice alarm clock. The screen is really nice and clear and it isn\\'t super loud when the alarm goes off. The only 2 downfall\\'s with this are, it is pretty small, and it is a bit bright and you can\\'t dim it more.\\n__label__1 Deceiving.: The product itself works great, however the description is very deceiving because it is not the size the description suggests.\\n__label__1 Easy to use but just fine: I have a problem waking up in the morning and so I use a couple of alarms.This alarm allows one to have different colors for display which is good but I wonder how useful it is.Pro:The alarm is smallIts sturdyCon:The plastic makes it look cheap but that is not a reason to complain either.The volume level is fixed : not as loud as I thought.Somewhere not worth the price. But guess thats what $11 can give.\\n__label__1 What time is it...?: Well, this clock arrived and I was excited as I really needed a new clock and liked the idea of being able to change the color of the LCD! Surprise, the clock\\'s LCD didn\\'t light up at all, which means you can\\'t tell the time---kind of a deal-breaker when you buy a digital clock! This was the second clock I ordered in less than a month that arrived defective, so this was pretty annoying.\\n__label__2 wonderful/insightful/hysterical...: ...need i say more? hmmmm...let\\'s see...what else CAN i say...?i love this book. sarah vowell is a brilliant young writer, with a biting sense of humor. this collection echoes (i suspect) the sentiments of many disillusioned americans (make that *millions*) who still wonder how in the wild, wild world of sports dubbya became president. beyond that, however, is a sweet and funny look into the heart of this talented woman as she takes us though some darn interesting moments in her coventional-yet-not-really-coventional upbringing.she\\'s funny.she\\'s smart.she\\'s ... funny and smart. hers is a voice that stands out in a sea of mediocre essayists. trust me, agree or disagree with her politics, you\\'ll still enjoy her sense of history as it relates to our world today! : )\\n__label__2 The Stickers Rock!: At 2 1/4 cents for each sticker this book is the bargain of all time! The sticker slogans are super cool and the quality is as good as individually sold stickers, so my recommendation is to load up on this book - you\\'ll never buy stickers this cheap again.\\n__label__1 Not so sticky: The stickers have many great sayings, but they\\'re not as sticky as ones I\\'ve bought at record shops and other places. In a collage of stickers gathered from many places, these were the only ones to peel up on their own (within two days).\\n__label__2 Best gift yet!!: I have bought multiple copies of this book for gifts. It is a huge hit with all ages - from teenagers to youthful adults. Buy several to keep on hand. You won\\'t be sorry.\\n__label__1 Very Cool Collection but Disappointing: While all the slogans are great and the amount of stickers is more than enough, I was quite disappointed in the quality. The description above clearly says the sticker are vinyl. They are not and seem to be paper. Either way they barely stick to anything I put them on if at all and are easily damaged when wet. Sure its a book of cheap stickers but I was really hoping they would last on my car more than a trip to the store before falling off. I suppose if you\\'re looking to sloganize your workspace or public places then go ahead and get the book. If you\\'re looking for quality stickers spend a few bucks on select slogans and go for quality.\\n__label__1 I give up: this book is unreadable: I\\'ve read the first chapter at least 10 times, and believe me, I don\\'t mind doing a little literary heavy lifting. I love James Joyce, and some of the other authors mentioned by reviewers who liked this book.Maybe it gets better, but the first chapter with this unknown character picking at her blemishes and fantasizing about sucking out all the pus, and rubbing her own breasts.... sorry. Not for me.\\n__label__1 Too difficult to get hay out.: I thought this looked like a good idea, but actually my bunny can\\'t get the hay out of it. Instead she knocks it down everyday so she can eat out of the top- and when she can\\'t knock it down, she doesn\\'t eat any.I would NOT buy this again. You might as well put the hay in a bowl.\\n__label__1 Shame on the record companies that release inferior-quality product.: I purchased this CD and was very disappointed because of the poor sound quality. This was obviously not made from the original masters as the volume is very low and the music has no dynamic range whatsoever. Instead of buying this inferior-quality CD I recommend your buying the \"Una Dimension De Exitos\" CD because its sound quality is MUCH better in every way.\\n__label__1 Are you kidding: The book is a non starter. It will be silly to beleive that this is all they ask for the exam. Because there is absolutely no solid information at all.Towards the end you will feel that the authors wrote this book while watching Jerry Springer show. They simply did not seemed to care about it anymore.Page 285 - The only information about Samba is a half page print out of the homepagePage 286 - 287 : unnecessary lengthy /etc/hosts file are printed 3 times. Page 282 : half page printout of homepageRight from the beginning, the book is crammed with serious mistakes.My estimate is that if the authors try hard for about 2 years, they will start to understand linux. Then they will have to spend another 5-7 years to become good in it. Only after that should they even think about teaching linux.\\n__label__1 wonderful pack of mistakes: Page # 236\"A zombie is a process whose parent has terminated and cannot clear references to the child process\"He even goes one more level and says...\"chare 1870 1 7 17:25 ? 00:00:01 kwmThe output of ps indicates that the process is now a zombie and is owned by the init process\"This clearly shows his ignorance about the basic definition of a zombie process. What else do you expect from someone whose only experience is clicking some silly microsoft buttons. Shame on you authors.It makes me so angry that some cheap MS guy managed to get guy 40$ from me for this useless book.By the way a zombie process is a process which is already dead ( and hence the name zombie ) , but whose parent is still alive, but has not yet asked for the process termination status. ( So the OS still keeps parts of the dead process\\' process table thinking that some time later the parent is going to ask for the status - wait system call. This results in the wastage of system resources ).\\n__label__2 Sweet and small, but lovely as well.: While the necklace is small as other reviewers have stated, and a little flatter than the photo reflects, it is still graceful and sweet and nice quality. I am overall pleased with the product and would order again if need arises.\\n__label__1 Poor quality: My son bought it for his mom for mothher\\'s day.I must say the packaging was acceptable but the chain started to turn grey to black within one week of use.This has disappointed my son because it is the first time he has actually purchase something for his mom.I am presently seeking my money back.\\n__label__2 Great modern Christmas album: I always reach for this album when I want to listen to something Christmas-y, but am sick of all the traditional songs. This album has a nice mix of new Christmas songs and new takes on old ones. I particularly like the ones by Harry Connick, Jr. and Dido. I scoffed at it when my husband brought it home, but once I listened to it, I loved it. Actually, I\\'m listening to it write now and it inspired me to buy a few albums by some of the artists.\\n__label__2 The whole series is 5 stars!!: The entire series is one that I enjoy reading over and over. It has crime solving, romance, and the supernatural! Her ideas on the afterlife in the books are very thought provoking. For anyone who likes vampires, werewolves, etc this is a must read!\\n__label__2 looking for the rest of the book: Broken was a bit of a disappointment. It is a quick read and not a bad book, but I was looking for a little bit more. There are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book, but none of them really mature. It left me wanting more, which isn\\'t a problem that I normally have with Ms. Armstrong\\'s books. Even the main storyline, with the portal unleashing a Jack the Ripper-like killer seemed shallow. There is little Pack interaction. The witches are only mentioned. Jamie pops in with a narrative hook, that goes nowhere. The newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else.As I\\'m reading, it occurred to me that the book, just well, seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last \"Elena\" book. Evidently, I\\'m not the only one thinking \"tired\" since there is a teaser for a new series by Armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different. It is about a woman \"completely of this world,\" according to the teaser.\\n__label__1 A mature, immature book: I guess I am the minority with my review. I thought this book was a yawn. Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler\\'s angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for \\'mature\\' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the \\'love\\' between the main character and her brother is just \\'beautiful\\', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings. In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it.\\n__label__1 Be careful: Before using any inversion therapy talk with your orthopedic doctor as use may aggrevate, inflame, or even cause further damage to those suffering from back pain. There are also studies that show ocular (eye) damage may occur due to the increase in blood pressure. Strokes are also a possibility. Be forewarned.\\n__label__2 DVD information didn\\'t play: The DVD did not play anywhere. I tryed on 2 DVDs players and a computer.Could you please send a new copy to me? Also I saw on tv that they are offering the same product for $14.99 for a try-out, but I payd $299 for mine. What\\'s going on?Thanks,Luiz Coelho\\n__label__2 Goes with everything: I bought this cardigan because it looked a little more dressy and I liked the way it looked paired with the tank (which I also bought in mauve). I was surprised whtne the cardigan went with everything. It is longer than I expected, so it goes well with the tunics that were in style this fall/winter. I also love the detailing of the sleeves, and the little pockets. The material is soft, and has the slightest sheen to it - I can\\'t imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon. What I love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile - so far I\\'ve worn it with tanks and turtlenecks, every color imaginable (I bought it in white). The versatility also means it can go with dressy, business and casual wear - and I\\'ve worn all three. It has become a staple in my wardrobe.\\n__label__1 Not what I exspected from EVA.......: Ok,the series was great no doubt about that but this video...well lets just say it wasent entertaining at all..They could have made it much better but all it seemed to be was Shinji in a chair lots of flashbacks and talking.Its not really the end..and it makes you want to see more but this was such a disapointment to me..I returned it back to the store.Itll be good to see just for the sake of seeing it but not worth $30!Sorry but the onley reason this got a star is becuase it was the subtitled Japanese verion and the last 5 mins was cool.Well thats all I have to say..sorry.... (It also make you wonder if the creator had any mentle problems)\\n__label__1 HUH ?!?: excuse me but did i miss sumthing ?!? i mean one minute rei is blowing up her eva the next you go into the minds of the pilotswhat the hell ?!?p.s. does anyone know where to get the moves in english in australia !\\n__label__1 12 excelent videos ruined by the end.: It has been said that a good story teller doesn\\'t tell you a story, but insteads allows you to find out about the story yourself through clues and other hints. That is what has made the first twelve videos so extraordinary and that is what loses me on the last one.The instramentality project as Singe accepting that he has more worth then he thinks he does. Geesh I would hope that the world has not been spending countless dollars and man hours on a project that allows people to figure out something that they would eventually figure out themselfs..Sorry guys the movie ending makes much more sense to me.\\n__label__2 Emotionally satisfying and endearing: Patrick Gale has written yet another fine book full of believable characters and unpredictable plots. I have read all of his books and found them to be consistently well written, entertaining, and thought-provoking. This book delves into the infinite complexities of human relationships but does not become ponderous. His sudden and eccentric plot twists keep the reader stimulated and guessing. This book may seem dark at first, but don\\'t give up - there is a rare treat in store. I have eagerly awaited Patrick Gale\\'s each new offering for the last 10 years and have yet to be disappointed.\\n__label__2 Campy Good Fun: I am a fan of the stage show and yet I still love this movie. First of all Dolly Parton IS Miss Mona . . . she is perfectly charming. This movie is like Grease . . . Let me explain . . . the movie doesn\\'t match the stage show and yet it stands on it\\'s own and has become a cult classic. It is even better on DVD . . . it\\'s widescreen and you get to see so much more.\\n__label__1 Unsubstantiated Account: This book has no basis for the items presented as facts. Obviously, not a song critic; the author shows no appreciation at all for the lyrics and verse that captured, and still captures the world. The accounts of John Denver\\'s personality were also written as fact instead of the farce that it is. Members of his family, children and ex-wives; continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving. This is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope. He was, however, a man and problems he had with alcohol and relationships are outlined in his autobiography...and not very different from the evils many people face from day to day.\\n__label__1 All About Collis: I was vastly disappointed in this book. It would only rate a C as a freshman term paper. Collis mostly writes his gut level reaction to Denver\\'s songs and the cultural events of the fifties through nineties with absolutely no attempt to analyze or substantiate. Why on a book about Denver do we have a page and a half about Rosa Parks? Was Denver there with her on the bus? One would find more content on Denver\\'s life in a People Magazine article.\\n__label__2 Excellent text for a working Process Engineer: As a Process Engineer, working in both operations and design in the upstream oil industry, it is pleasing to find a text that finally covers all the unit operations you are likely to encounter in oil processing. The book is an easy read that doesn\\'t get weighed down in first principles. This means that you can quickly get the information you require and have confidence in your decisions. It\\'s a must for anyone working in the industry, especially those who may be offshore, I always have my copy with me.\\n__label__2 Above Average Military Sci-Fi: Ditto. This book, and the previous one (Semper Mars) both provide solid summer escape reading. Unlike Sherman & Cragg\\'s \"Starfist\" or Diehl\\'s \"Legion of the Damned\" series, Douglas\\'s characters are actually believable.For those of you who like Douglas\\'s (ie. Bill Keith\\'s) work, I also recommend his \"Seals: The Warrior Breed\" series, written under another pseudonym, H. Jay Riker. While not exactly sci-fi, this is a great series for techno-thriller buffs.\\n__label__2 Read my review of Semper Mars and you know: I was a non-combat Coast Guardsman. My Marine friends lived a different life than I. Wonderfully written, great continuation of Sempervivum Mars experience\\n__label__2 I\\'m a programmer, this is necessary.: I\\'m a computer programmer and I use all those funky buttons on the keyboard all day long. I appreciate the layout of the page-up, home, end keys and such. If you do a lot of typing, I think you need an adjustable keyboard. Those Microsoft and Logitech split keyboards are poor substitutes. You\\'ve still got to make sure to stretch and take breaks; the keyboard isn\\'t a miracle. However, I would not be able to do my job with a normal keyboard.\\n__label__1 Rip off: I bought this book for college Microbiology. It was a decent price but when I went to my first class the professor had us check to see if we had all the chapters. This book does NOT!!! It\\'s missing 9 chapters! So if you need them I would not get this book.\\n__label__2 Perfect genre material of the late 60\\'s: The acid trip scene is worth the price of admission alone; a perfect teen/parent clash of what life was like in the late 60\\'s. A must-own for people age 50 & over\\n__label__2 great phone!!!: its been a while since i found a phone that i can respect and say \"oooohhhh \" and \"ahhhhh\" to. this is THE phone. great design, great features and cool UI. all the features u can possibly want. wireless connectivity is excellent. the music feature is great and the speaker is the loudest i have ever heard on a phone. the only thing that i have to pick on a little is the earpiece volume. it could be a little louder but that all depends on how u put it against your ear. play around with the position and the volume changes dramatically.\\n__label__1 Poor quality: While the \"easy pour\" feature is nice, the plastic itself is very poor quality. It makes the milk smell plasticy, is fragile and leaks. Also, the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar. In my opinion, the nice easy pour feature isn\\'t worth wasting the money on the bags. I reccommend Lansinoh brand bags!\\n__label__2 Small Portraits But Great Quality: This is a very cute kit with a good variety of subjects from the Eiffel tower to a rocket in space. The guide included was great at showing what colors are needed for each portrait and what colors you will need to mix. I do think that the quality of the brush could be better and the portraits were a bit smaller than I would have liked. I had to squint quite a lot for some pictures to make sure the right paint got in the right spot but I really had fun with this kit and would buy it again.\\n__label__1 good pictures, but unusable.: The paints were all dried out and not able to be used. The pictures are incredibly small, and the lines are way to faint. I think you pay for the book of the history of paint-by-numbers, which frankly, I could care less about. I am writing a not to the company, and am very unsatisfied with this product.\\n__label__1 Paint boards TOO small: I bought this for my 12 year old daughter (who does a lot of paint by numbers). She didn\\'t like this kit because of the size of the paintings.The actual paintings are about 5x7 card size. They are REALLY small. There is no way they can expect you to paint this in a tiny dot so small.It is more advanced (in my opinion) in that you are supposed to use their drawing as guidelines and paint over it how you want. You will never be able to fill in the little sections.\\n__label__1 kinda boring/1 pragraph of school work changes by abby: this story was kinda boring or maybe even all boring but i just had to read it for school.I thought it was becuase it was extremley slow. some of the chapters only talked about depress depress and depress.It was kinda interesting in some chapters. I thought rosamunde didnt really realize how rude she was and poor izzy had to go through her. i would have told her to shutup to listen to me. I think that Marco should have been punished. Marco should have been put into jail or his driver\\'s license should have been taken away. I think Rosamunde should have been nicer. It was nice of Lisa to respond to the action mature and not freak out like Suzy, and Lauren. In the begining Tony would stand up for Izzy and she would have never lost her leg.\\n__label__1 OK... but really boring: I had to read this book for summer reading like so many other kids. It wasn\\'t too bad but... most of it was just boring. Half the book your reading about Izzy while she\\'s in the hospital and it just gets so boring. I\\'m a boy and I think this book was targeted towards girls... but I had to read it for school. The book tried to make you feel sorry for Izzy buy you know what? I wasn\\'t sorry for her. The characters were so dull and boring. I didn\\'t care about them at all.\\n__label__1 Nicole\\'s revised review of Izzy, Willy-Nilly: This book was not that good for me. It went too slow. I like adventure books and this is not one of them.My book is about Izzy goes to a party. Her date was drinking and they got into a wreck. She had to get her leg amputated. She got really depressed because she was in a stuffy hospital and her room was just plain it wasn\\'t different. Which she liked being different from everybody else. When she got to go home she found out she had to get a fake leg. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books that go slow, and are boring. This book just went on and on talking she described every little detail. I could just fall asleep reading this book.\\n__label__1 this book is boring: this book is really boring i advise u not to read it you\\'ll fall a sleep reading it DON\\'T READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!\\n__label__1 What was the point of this book???: I had to read this book for summer reading and found that it was really BAD. Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn\\'t really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her \"friends\" she befriended an \"odd\" girl named Rosamunde who she\\'d never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and \"nice\" and I didn\\'t understand why she would\\'t take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she\\'d made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn\\'t Izzy\\'s type. The story had no heart... it didn\\'t make me like the characters, it didn\\'t make me happy, it didn\\'t make me sad, it was just boring.\\n__label__2 Izzy Willy-Nilly: This book was a very well written book. The story about Izzy was very realistic. This is a good story for teenagers to read about drinking and driving and about how it can ruin your life. To go to a life that is perfect to \"not so perfect\" is very hard to deal with. I would recommend all this book to all teenagers.\\n__label__1 Not as good as previous models: This tester is not as good as previous models. My employer has an older tester of this make and model and it works much better than this one.\\n__label__2 Hysterically touching: This is my favorite Jack Lemmon movie. I first saw it about 15 years ago when it was recommended to me by my girlfriend at the time. In fact, I loved the movie so much, I followed the plot and left her!Check it out; it is worthwhile.\\n__label__1 Battery Lasted 10 Months: When I first received this battery, it worked fine. But after 10 months it will no longer hold a decent charge. I can\\'t talk on my cordless phone for longer than 10 minutes. I am going to order a replacement battery from a different manufacturer that has a 4-1/2 star rating.By the way of comparison, the original battery I got with the phone lasted 4 years.\\n__label__2 Worth every penny: Sonia Uvezian has provided us with a truly engaging, scholarly exploration of one of the world\\'s most exciting culinary traditions. If you want to become knowledgable about Armenian cooking, this exceptional book, which is packed with valuable information and splendid recipes you won\\'t find elsewhere, is essential.\\n__label__2 nice pens: Great pens for the price, just remember to put the cap on when not in use. Makes writing easy.\\n__label__1 AAAAAH...I CAN\\'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT A CASSETE PLAYER FOR THIS: ok, i think maybe a 12 year old may benefit from this tape. this whole freaking tape was common sense just about. i learned one thing in this whole tape. i don\\'t think the other reviewers were reviewing the same thing. there is nothing good about this tape. please believe me and dont get it please.\\n__label__2 Cool Magician: Saw the guy in person & loved the show. Ordered the book for a nephew so he could try some of the tricks. Written for kids to be able to do.\\n__label__2 CEO\\'S DREAM BOOK FOR MANAGING BUSINESS PROCESSES: I have read a few hundred \"non-fictional\" books over the years for my MBA, for quality, etc, but I have to tell you that this book about the use of balanced scorecards is the best business related book that I have ever read, and I feel that every CEO should completely absorb it to utilize its \"pertinent\" applications that are applicable to their business processes, thus institutionalizing the process metrics\\' continual improvement concepts of ISO/TS 16949:2002 and ISO 9001 in all types of firms, including those that are not automotive suppliers!- Bill Cooper, Global Quality Systems Senior Manager, Lear Corporation\\n__label__2 One of the 5 best books I\\'ve ever read: There are only a few stories that haunt me. This is one of them. I read this 10 years ago and am watching parts of it slowly come true. Things that were novel and futuristic when I first read it are everyday occurances now. I wonder how much more of the book will come to life...\\n__label__2 Call Me Mrs. Miracle: The DVD came packaged well. The DVD is good quality and plays well. Like having the information about the DVD available inside the case.\\n__label__2 Call me Mrs. Mircle: The second part of this movie is move than excellent to be watched. Time is worth watching this again and again and watched at least more than ten times\\n__label__1 Too little or too late: I ordered this book on a recommendation - as a solution. Unfortunately, it was not the right solution for me, though it certainly may be for others. Personally, I find life becoming more and more multi-dimensional and multi-faceted with multitudinous opportunities and challenges. Reducing wounds to five and then pinning body types on certain wounds with certain recipies for healing was just too reduced for my taste. It forced me to identify with all the wounds and all the body types and simply didn\\'t take who I am in 2010 into consideration. But again, maybe it\\'s just me...\\n__label__1 Not as good as the real thing: I bought this CD expecting something very similar to an original cast recording. However this CD has little to no resemblance to the offical soundtrack. The lyrics are the same, and the vocals are somewhat similar to the real thing, but instrumentally this CD is lacking. It sounds like the CD was put together using a keyboard. However, for someone not quite as picky as I am this is a great listen, the words are moving and the music, though not holding to Webber\\'s original score, is good.\\n__label__2 Midori is eloquent and smart: The psychology, aesthetics and philosophy of erotic power exchange, D/s and S&M. Written with wit, imagination and intelligence. For someone new to BDSM it may help with self-acceptance and confidence. For all levels it may enhance your own understanding of what it is that we do.\\n__label__1 Another terrible book, like Osterbrock: This is another of the books I had to use for my graduate ISM course. I dont know what the problem is, but every book Ive read on the ISM was terrible at explaining things (because confusion in this subject is very easy), and none of them have an INDEX thats worth a crap. So dont expect to be able to do the homework problems in there.Dopita is written a little better than Osterbrock, and there isnt the ridiculous amount of tables strewn within the text, but its not MUCH better.\\n__label__2 Bring T:TM BACK!!!!!!!: Hi, I am 23 and I am a huge fan of the transformers. The animated motion picture was by far my favorite. Alot of the cartoons now pale in comparison the the quality of the movie. I just wish that your company would get this great classic back in stock. I would sure be hot to get a copy of it. Hail to Optimus Prime!!!\\n__label__2 The sweetness of an acomplished writer, the sting of satire: A Hive for the Honey Bee is an excellent book- and will bring pleasure to all ages. Combining satire and a genuine love of life, the novel explores the life of the honey bee in fine detail- without boring us with unnecessary technicalities. The sort of novel which ought to be a treasured part of your bookshelf.\\n__label__1 Worthless: Kills the signal so much, the reciever doesn\\'t even see it. It\\'s about a shade of pink on the other side. I am hooking this up to a PS3 and DVR to a JBL reciever. Everything works well with just the stright through calbes. But no matter what you do with a optical signal. It chokes all the time. Best of to convert to digital coaxal cable or worst off to buy a new reciever.\\n__label__1 Crap Out !!!: One of the worst movies I\\'ve seen in a long while. Tracy Jordan is not funny. Just infantile and one of the worst actors currently on the big screen. Bruce Willis must have had one more movie in his contract , cause I just can\\'t see why he would willingly agree to do this film. I didn\\'t buy this film from amazon. I did watch it on HBO.Really , Really , Really sucks.\\n__label__1 Bu-Ray Review: One of, if not, the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen. What the hell happened here? How could anyone like this movie?\\n__label__1 I Cannot Believe that Bruce Willis would stoop so low ....: This movie was a huge disappointment to me ! I trust Bruce Willis to deliver entertaining, family action fun. But never again -- i cannot believe that he took this script ! yech ! if you like obscene, good-ol\\'-boy trash, you might like this one. but not with your kids, and not me ! shame on you, Bruce Willis, for disappointing your fan base.\\n__label__1 Please do not spend money on this movie...it sucks trust me: i never write reviews but i saw this movie the other day and it\\'s that bad that i had to come on here and write this.They tried to make a lot of scenes funny but it wasn\\'t it was just annoying because of how hard they were trying to make it that way, alot of the jokes made no sense to..plz rent it if anything. hope this helps\\n__label__1 Cop Out: Save your money.This is a bad movie.The acting is poor and the story is stupid.Not well produce as well written.\\n__label__2 the brat pack: it is the best collection i purchased because of the 3 movies and the music compact disc that comes included. thank you raul\\n__label__1 Quite Simply..: A pointless re-release of the High School Reunion box set, although this box set features an Exclusive \\'80s Music CD. All three films come in a anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen presentation with the choice of Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 audio. The DVDs also include a theatrical trailer for each film, and a interactive menu for each film. In other words, they\\'re all barebones discs, and this box set is a pointless re-release.\\n__label__2 Good Set (If You Don\\'t Already Own the Films): The infamous double-dip. I previously didn\\'t own these, waiting for some features, which this set definitely has. My advice is that if you already own them, it\\'s not worth it. If you don\\'t, buying them all together in this set is a good deal.My only complaint would be the size of the case. It\\'s too tall to fit on my shelve, but besides that, I\\'ve got nothing bad to say.\\n__label__1 Weird Science?: Pretty in Pink should have been bundled with this set, NOT Weird Science!Stick to the theme, people!Weird Science would have been more appropriately-bundled with a film such as, Zapped!Also, where are all the special features?\\n__label__2 Excellent for Lyrics But Lacking In Music Information: This is an amazing book as far as teaching you one of the fundamental aspects of song writing goes, which is giving the song proper STRUCTURE. It teaches song structure from strictly a lyricist\\'s point of view however, such as verse/chorus structures or verse/bridge etc. The book is worth its weight in gold for this info alone. But it lacks ANY information on how to write the music for the song. But nevertheless, it has some greeaattt ideas. Buy it for its really cool ideas on how to write song lyrics (but don\\'t look for music composition in it.) One of the great ideas it has, though, is to write lyrics while listening to one of your favorite song\\'s music. Conversely, you could write the music for your song\\'s lyrics, by arranging your music to one of your favorite song\\'s lyrics. Do you see what I\\'m saying. This really really works to give you an awesome song structure!\\n__label__1 Shattered handle in a sealed box!: Stopped at Macy\\'s to take a look at this. The sales clerk opened a sealed box to reveal a SHATTERED handle. Buyer beware. Seems awful.Compared to other pressure cookers, the design of the large handle on this one seems to be inherently easy to break.Also note that a 6-quart cooker is too small for most uses. Remember, you can only fill half-way with soup, and a piece of meat cannot extend higher than 3/4 the height of the cooker. Check out the Presto 8 quart that costs about 25% less and includes excellent customer service. Just my 2 cents!\\n__label__1 Arrived with broken handle and Made in China: My 10 quart Fagor Duo arrived today on Halloween. I opened the outer Amazon box to retrieve the inner Fagor box and I immediately hear stuff sliding around inside. I opened the box up and the lower handle is broken off and little grainy pieces of plastic are everywhere in the bottom of the box. I will be returning this item for sure for a refund. The box does say \"Made in China\". I would not trust the websites that say it is made in Spain.\\n__label__1 Arrived with handles and valve damaged: Arrived via UPS in intact outer carton. Factory Fagor carton had one small dent in it. On removing the cooker, the lid and pot handles were broken, almost as if someone had taken a hammer to them - shattered would be a better term. The pressure valve also was chipped. Called Fagor and they acted as if this had never happened before, even though multiple other one star evaluations mention the same problem. The item was unusable and I sent it back and got a refund. In view of this experience I bought another brand of 8 qt pressure cooker stainless (Manttra), 2 pressure settings and $30 cheaper and it works great.\\n__label__1 poor quality, lousy/nonexistent customer service: The first Fagor Duo I purchased in 2009 was and still is great - no problems. But in Feb 2011 I bought another Duo from Macy\\'s, and needed to return it because lid wouldn\\'t lock into place. The replacement Duo has had lid-locking trouble as well, followed by, when 3 months\\' new, the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot/handle cannot be repaired. With my repeated calls and emails to Fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced, I was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response; if they replied at all, it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself! Finally gave up and returned the pot to store for a refund.\\n__label__2 Fagor Pressure Cooker: I\\'ve used the pressure cooker several times since receiving it. It reaches the pressure point quickly, cooks great and easy cleanup.\\n__label__1 Way too simple: The majority of the information in this book is pretty basic and is already covered in any basic UNIX text. Anyone who doesn\\'t know most of what is in the first half of the book has no business having root access to begin with. Seriously, if you don\\'t know how to use cp, ls or man commands (all discussed in the book) you aren\\'t ready to be a UNIX sysadmin. The bottom line is that if you have been a sysadmin for more than two months this book isn\\'t much use. I guess all the good stuff is discussed in the *advanced* system administrators guide but I was so disappointed in this book that I won\\'t bother getting it.\\n__label__1 Fall Apart: My son wanted this toy and when he received it he was unable to play with it. It falls apart at the slightest touch. I have tried to find a way to super glue to no avail. I would stongly recommend not buying this. Way to much aggravation for parent and child alike.\\n__label__1 Could have been better: Whilst I concede the Mr Leckie\\'s prose style is easily-paced and therefore Hannibal is the kind of book you could probably read in a single afternoon, all this book really achieves is to prove you cannot write a fictional biography of one of history\\'s most captivating figures in a mere 241 pages. I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal\\'s boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written. If you like historical fiction set in the Roman period buy it, if not, don\\'t.\\n__label__2 old but good.: it was fun. If you use to play online these were available for free back when. Was fun to play again.\\n__label__1 Old video: The box came in good shape, but the video when played has that wiggly stripe on the top of the picture- the one you get when the video is old and played too much.Thsi video was supposed to be in excellent condition. Definitely not better than OK condition.\\n__label__2 Beautiful: It is beautiful a little smaller than I thought but no problem. The pendant is very well done very delicate. I gave it to my mother and she loved it.\\n__label__2 Great gift for Mom: I purchased this Loving Family Necklace for my Mom for Mother\\'s Day. They come with all different size families and really send a strong, caring message. She cried. ;-)\\n__label__2 My Son Loves This!: I bought this for my 8-yr old son who says he wants to be a paleontologist when he grows up. I love that it was not necessarily easy to uncover the bones, he did it little by little over several days. Yes it was messy that didn\\'t bother us, easy clean up. The bones were flexible so you didn\\'t have to worry about breaking them as you uncovered them. We also used a little chisel to help as someone else had noted. We are just putting it together today so I can\\'t yet vouch for how well it will stay together. Taking other\\'s comments into consideration though.\\n__label__2 Great beginner book at good price: I am a Classic ASP developer. The company that I work for has recently decided to pursue .NET for future web development. This was the first book that I read in order to get a grasp of the changes from Classic ASP to ASP.NET. I have to say that this book was a GREAT introduction to a lot of the new features of ASP.NET.There are a few things I would like to point out when considering buying this book:1.This is a beginner book. No advanced topics.2.Good coverage of the different types of controls available in .NET.3.Quick and easy read.4.Only basic coverage of ADO.NET.5.Source code available as a download.6.Assumes that you have VS.NET although I used ASP.NET Web Matrix.There were some typos but nothing ridiculous.Overall I like this book. Good price for a good book.\\n__label__2 Good Quick Book full of examples: Pros:1. The book really gets you to the code quickly which is what I like.2. The book features code in both VB.NET and C#(Francis B Gallagher from catonsville review incorrectly mentions that it does not contain code from both the lang. The author mentions on pg 42 that due to space constraints he will list only one lang or the other. The \"other\" code is available on the website.)Cons:I did not give it 5 stars because it assumes that you have already worked on ASP before and keeps making annoying comparisons throughout the text.\\n__label__1 Outdated: This book is outdated and would have been fine a decade ago. .NET is version 4+ now, a good bit has changed.\\n__label__1 Sloppy editing: I bought this book recently to learn ASP.NET and feel I have mainly wasted my money. In the main the author simply has not put himself into the place of the newbie he aims the book at.Rather than give opinions, let me quote specific examples from an early chapter. Listing 4.1 gives code to be added to the page_load method. When you try to run it it doesn\\'t work. You find out 3 pages later that you should have added a group of \"using\" statements. It would have been easy to add these lines to the snippet, or at least give a forward reference to them.In the same snippet you\\'re invited to open a database named \"pubs\" (Publications) The following snippets perform various functions on this database. But this is not a standard database, and you\\'re given no details of how it\\'s put together so you can mock up your own in Access or whatever.I advise against this book.\\n__label__1 Works poorly and very poor documentation: Don\\'t waste your money on this poorly made poor documentation device. If you need technical support you are connected with India support line. Good luck trying to understand what they are saying. After they read their script to say how sorry they are and then after speaking to 3 different technical support staff the made in china Hawking still fails to work properly with Mac computer. complete waste of money\\n__label__1 Not worth the trouble: I work in IT and I find this piece of equipment to be ridiculously complicated. I think eventually it is possible to make it work correctly but there are many many things you can do wrong in trying to set it up. My first one worked well for a few weeks, but then started giving only an intermittent signal. Tech support talked me through about 6 troubleshooting steps over 3 calls and finally had me send it back. It took 2 weeks to get an RMA# and then only after I called them to say what\\'s up. I sent it back and again two weeks before I called again and they sent one overnight. I guess they don\\'t do anything unless you complain. This new one seems to work fine except I can\\'t get it to successfully extend an encrypted network of any level encryption. An unsecured network extends very well, but who wants to leave their network open? So it\\'s back to tech support to see if they can explain what I\\'m doing wrong.\\n__label__2 Good product, worked easily.: Easily connected to the wireless link with the software. If you want a stronger link (long distance between router) would recommend getting an additional antenna.\\n__label__2 Worked as advertised: My purpose for buying this range extender was to allow connection to home network from outside of the home. It works well and allows use of handheld, netbook and laptop computers from distances of 50 to 75 feet outside of the home. It also allowed me to connect a security camera to the home network that I had been unable to use prior to this purchase. It actually acts as a new hotspot. Well worth the money and very easy to setup. I would recommend it to anyone.\\n__label__1 Hawking is useless: Can access the Hawking HWREG1 Wireless G Range Extender very well from 3 laptops and a PS3. On the otherhand, it does not allow internet access. Therefore, it is a brick that serves no purpose (Might could use it for a doorstop). It extended the range of what could not be done already. Called support, they had no clue of what to do. Therefore, I cannot recommend this product. It does not work and tech support is non-existent. Rather, I would suggest staying away from it. It is the first product that I have bought that was completely useless.\\n__label__1 Didn\\'t work: Box said it was simple to install and set up, I beg to differ it didn\\'t work and offshore tech support was useless as I couldn\\'t understand the Tech.Sent it back for refund.\\n__label__1 Not very functional: Like many of the other posters, the toy bag does not stick to our bathroom wall. This is very frustrating because when it is full of toys and it falls off the wall it makes a loud noise and a big mess. It falls off the wall even when it is empty, which is still annoying because it should stay on the wall.The other issue I had was the blue dye on the fabric bled onto many of the soft plastic toys or sponges.\\n__label__1 One side won\\'t stick to my walls: Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn\\'t seem to want to stick to the walls.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t stay stuck: This product does not stay stuck to our bathtub walls. It is constantly falling and it\\'s very frustrating. I would not recommend this product to anyone.\\n__label__1 disappointed: The suction cups won\\'t stick to the formica around our tub. I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile, but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can\\'t get it to stick either. Now that I think about it, suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too, so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder. This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money, I\\'m going to try the kidco storage caddy instead. I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.\\n__label__1 It was boring: I\\'ll make this short. If you read the books this one was based on, well, you know what\\'s going to happen, and it sucks all the anticipation of it. I\\'m sorry to say this, but I like not knowing the ending because then anything can happen. Knowing what\\'s going to happen is seriously boring and sucky.\\n__label__2 Nice little appliance: Very nice inexpensive yogurt maker.. The only problem I had at first was that the yogurt wasn\\'t thick enough but I found that if I leave it on for about 6 hours it is good. I also put the cooled yogurt in a coffee filter to strain out more of the liquid.. This makes it much better when adding berries and such, It stays thick.\\n__label__2 Carefree yogurt maker: The Salton YM9 yogurt maker is compact, easy to use and clean. I find it works best and fastest if commercial yogurt with active cultures (such as Dannon plain) is used as the starter and regular milk, rather than dry, is used for the base. The final product is sweet and creamy, despite warnings that homemade yogurt cannot rival the texture and consistency of commercial yogurt. Not so in my case. This was a great buy that I\\'m very pleased with. Note that you\\'ll need a candy thermometer or food thermometer that reads temperatures as low as 100 degrees and as high as 160 degrees.\\n__label__2 cheap and easy to make yogurt: I used to teach intermediate level microbiology in college and learned how to make yogurt from milk, powdered milk and a spoonful of live yogurt for starting culture. In addition I\\'m a big fan of Brown Cow Cream top yogurt and they are expensive at $3.50 for 32 oz tub. Now I have found a way to make my very own Cream Top yogurt using this yogurt maker. I heat NON-homogenized whole milk with powdered milk until warm and add 1/2 cup of commercial yogurt. After 14 hours of incubation, I got a tub full of nice firm yogurt that was not tart nor too sour. After adding splenda and some dried fruit, I have a \"pick me up\" snack for any time in the day.\\n__label__2 wonderful product, it really does make yogurt: My wife has been trying to make yogurt for quite some time. She has tried the oven technique, careful temperature monitoring and various other book-suggested methods. I bought her this one, just as another method to tryout. It really works. Will the yogurt look like or have the same type of consistency as store bought yogurt.....no. but it comes pretty close to it. I read some of the reviews saying that it does not make yogurt like you can buy in the store. To that I say \" you will be enjoying natural yogurt with more nutrition (probiotic). Store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal. You can make store-bought like consistancy if you incorporate little bit of pectine or soluble fibre like agar agar powder. If you don\\'t like the excess water in home made yogurt, it is better to strain the water out with a cheese cloth. In that case you don\\'t have to add extra powder milk.\\n__label__1 Is this made of gold? silver?: I was planning on getting this, but the price is way way too much. $199?? $500??? Retail value for this item is $27. There are other yogurt makers much cheaper. This item has been discontinued. Usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance. It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt. The sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price. This is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such. Someone needs to get real and fix the price issue here. Amazon should not allow this sort of price gouging.\\n__label__1 Too small, useless: So small, it holds just a quart of milk(4 cups). The milk has to be boiled (it doesn\\'t do it). It just keeps the milk warm. You can make yogurt yourself without it. You can use container with lid to keep the milk warm. You don\\'t need to pay money to keep the milk warm.\\n__label__2 Low-cost, Delicious and Easy-to-make Yogurt!: I got the Salton YM9 yogurt maker for Christmas of 2004, so I\\'ve had a full year to really test the machine and hone my yogurt-making skills. The Salton yogurt maker is a no-frills, budget appliance; it is not one of those fancy, gourmet Euro-Cuisine or Donvier makers, which come with individual-sized glass jars and cost twice as much as the Salton. No, the Salton YM9 is a plastic, plug-in model, and it does the job FINE. I wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly, and, if you read most ingredient labels, is often made with high-fructose corn syrup. I prefer the 1-quart container because I make a big batch of plain yogurt once a week, and then add pureéd frozen fruit and Splenda to flavor it as I desire. It\\'s a healthful breakfast food or snack. I highly recommend this item.\\n__label__1 OK machine, but not what I expected.: I bought two of this item because people said that a 1 quart Mason jar fit inside it perfectly. Unfortunately, since those reviews were written, the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me. The glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it. Now, unless I can find a short fat quart jar, I am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set. Very disappointed. :(\\n__label__2 Priced right , easy to use, and the yogurt taste is wonderful: This has got to be the best buy of the year... I love kitchen toys and this one is my favorite.. Its so easy to use, and the benefits of making homemade yogurt, without additives? adding to the healthy choices of good eating? the Salton YM9 Yogurt Maker should be your next purchase.. It deserves more than a 5 star rating.\\n__label__2 Yogurt Supreme: The Salton YM9 is easy to use. The explicit directions in the manual are simple to follow. The yogurt produced is excellent. The plastic scoop spoon that comes with the YM9 is unnecessary. I like the 1 quart size rather than hassling with several small containers. Cleanup is a breeze and the YM9 is an attractive appliance. Make sure you have a candy thermometer as you will be preheating milk and mixing starter only after the milk has dropped to the right temperature. (note to Salton: dump the spoon and include thermometer) The YM9 is an inexpensive, easy to use, effective product...enjoy!\\n__label__2 Awesome: I have made almond milk yogurt using both apple and honey sweeteners, cashew milk yogurt, sprouted soy bean yogurt and sunflower yogurt which I made into cheese. The thing is totally versatile. I had to buy a non-dairy starter, but the people at Custom Probiotics made that simple, too. Easy to use; easy to clean. The yogurts I have made have fermented 4 - 8 hours with no problems. Altogether a great buy.\\n__label__2 Makes great yogurt: This little yogurt maker delivers great yogurt, although I would have preferred one with an automatic shutoff. Well worth the money, though. I highly recommend it.\\n__label__2 LOVE it!!: This kit really helped me! The nipple butter is WAY better than any lanolin cream and I\\'m sure it\\'s much healthier too! I also love the boobit tubes although I would love them more if they stayed cold longer. I am a bit lazy to use the compress too often but it really does make a difference. Tea is suprisingly yummy! It\\'s summertime at the moment in Southern California so I made a big piture of iced tea with it. yum!!\\n__label__2 I love this book!: I read this book with my 4 year old boy and my 7 year old daughter and they loved it! The storyline appeals to both boys and girls - My daughter loved the cohesiveness of the girls in the story and my son loves the silliness factor. This is such a great childrens book - reaching out to them on their level. I would highly recommend this book and cannot wait for the next installment!\\n__label__1 \"Folding\" is Pathetic: You fold this up and unless you have the case with you, you have 4 dangling posts about 8\" long each going every which way. I am going to have to look for a product that folds into itself, telescope style - far, far more practical.\\n__label__1 USER: You did not mention the extend, in inches, this cane can be adjusted. I\\'ll spend a couple more dollars and buy the Carex adjustable cane instead.\\n__label__2 I dig Roman numerals, and jewelry...: so buying this little ring was a no-brainer.It came quickly and appears just as it\\'s pic shows.Fits a lil snug for the size listed, but not uncomfortably.A good buy for the price if you\\'re looking for a simple ring with features it lists.I say it\\'s a 4* piece.\\n__label__1 Terrible: This documentary was absolutely awful. It follows a young and pretentious couple as they try to eat \"healthy\" on food stamps. Basically they aren\\'t willing to change their diet at all. Everything has to be fresh adn organic and they still try to buy the same expensive products they always have (plus where are they shopping? It looks like a Whole Foods or Central Market - NOT somewhere people on food stamps would actually be able to afford). They constantly complain about how they aren\\'t full and they can\\'t afford desert. They even have friends over for dinner - as if you can afford to feed your friends when you can\\'t even afford to feed yourslef. I watched this with a group of people - liberals and conservatives - and everyone equally hated it. I guess any idiot can make a documentary these days and call it factual. Don\\'t waste your time.\\n__label__1 leaded glass for wine: I am sure that leaded glass for drinking has been shown to be very liable to result in lead in the beverage. The longer it holds the beverage, the more lead disolves. I believe these glasses are not fit for human use!Joseph Crilly\\n__label__1 Not sturdy enough: I have very fine shoulder length hair and yet I cannot go a full day without these breaking, especially if I lie down. Not worth the money unless they are to be used for very small bunches of hair or children\\'s hair.\\n__label__2 Tough crystal, I hope: I got these glasses for a couple whose wine glasses are constantly getting broken. They previously got the Schott-Zweisel Forte (titanium) wine glasses (Cabernet/merlot), and these have been broken.It is too soon to tell if this reinforced crystal will last any better, but they are very nice glasses. They are good size, give the requisite chime upon clinking glasses and are very good-looking.\\n__label__1 Not at all like the Riedel bordeaux glasses.: Not at all what I thought. The reviews made this sound like the Reidel bordeaux glasses, but these hold maybe half the wine, are much smaller in volume, don\\'t have much of a balloon shape. Very disappointed. Don\\'t get these if your goal is to replicate the Reidel.\\n__label__1 A don\\'t learn Solaris book.: I can\\'t see how a book like this gets published, but there is no other Solaris book so many people are stuck with it. Examples are lame and only touches the surface. Sun Educational Services has excellent books that you get with the course (about $1500/5 days) that\\'s better. Why don\\'t they publish that instead?\\n__label__2 What Christmas Spurs means to me.: I love the book because at the time I read it a girl I new was suffering from luekiemia just like jimmy. I read it my sixth grade year and every time i see her I think of the book.It was very meaningful to me, I hope that it is a meaningful to you. Thank you for reading, hope you like the book.\\n__label__2 Quilling Rocks: This is a great book to add to your Quilling book library, I teach quilling at a college, and a few assistant living places, and I find that the designs offered in this book are great for single class projects. Lots of great ideas and inspiration for my students and I.\\n__label__1 Waste of money: I am a huge Easterbrook fan, especially of this TMQ column on ESPN. I figured this book would be interesting and on similar lines but I was greatly disappointed with it. Just a bunch of lines of text with pictures in between. Absolutely do not waste your money on this.\\n__label__2 Great portable nailer: Honestly a great finish nailer to use. It has lots of power and is really easy to handle with no air hose and compressor. If anyone is interested in this finish nailer I would highly recommened it. I have both the bostitch and a dewalt finish nailers and they don\\'t compare to this 18 volt dewalt model. One down side of the nailer can be the weight which is a little over eight pounds but you seem to get use to it. I got mine brand new at Lowes for $339 and it came in a pack with the 18 volt dewalt circular saw.\\n__label__1 Not as Described: This sword is advertised to have a brass guard when in fact it is only a brass color that is cheaply dipped over some type of metal. We understand now why it was priced as low as it is as it is a cheap wall hanger that should be hidden in a dark area of your room. Will I buy from this seller again? Likely not.\\n__label__2 Chilean Indian poetry: John Bierhorst, the translator of this volume, is a translator whose work I trust. In this bi- and tri-lingual text, he has justified my confidence in him.The poets translated in the volume have a varied amount of \"Indian-ness\" - some speak the Indian language of the group with which they identify, some do not. The poems themselves range from poems that show a non-Spanish aesthetic to those that are openly \"Spanish\" in some sense. For example, a poem by Jaime Luis Huenun is titled \"After Reading So Much Cesar Vallejo\", and three poems of Graciela Huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku.My favorite of the poets in Elicura Chihuailaf whose poems center around blue - a color with strong ties to the Indian culture. These poems are perhaps the most Indian, but the poems are universal in the depiction of humanity and its relationship to the rest of nature while being accessible and particular in terms of images.These poems are well worth your time.\\n__label__2 Royal Hunt best album by far!: Este disco lo compré de casualidad. Compré \"Paradox\" y jamás lo he escuchado. Tuve una corazonada y fue totalmente un acierto. Esta banda, de gran profundidad musical, se maneja a sus anchas y de que forma. Son muy pocas las bandas que pueden tocar tan bien en directo........Definitivamente, son sensacionales..I got this CD by pure casualty. I buyed \"Paradox\" and honestly, I have never heard it... but I got a premonition that this band is really good....the players well docted in classical music play and how they do it!!!!!! Only the superbands can perform in this way live were few tricks are allowed...........\\n__label__2 Great new RTS: Definitly a must for RTS fans. Hey it just released, and there are players around the world playing 24/7 so there gonna find the exploits, just hopefully EA will not get lazy early on like past RTS games and keep the patches comming.\\n__label__2 breadth but not depth: the book was a good broad overview of what to consider when creating a portfolio, however, it did not delve deeply into details, instead it provides other sources one should view for more info. still a helpful book.\\n__label__1 This Thriller Didn\\'t Thrill Me!: I\\'m glad Deviant Ways wasn\\'t the first book by Chris Mooney that I read, or it probably would have been the last. Deviant Ways has an interesting, although not very original, plot and it does have its moments of excitement. However, the characters never came to life for me and I found I gave up on caring what happened to them. Further, the \"bad guy\" seriously lacked credibility. It came to a point that I found myself skimming through the last third of the book, and the only real thrill I got from Deviant Ways was when I came to its end. Do yourself a favor and skip this book, but do read Remembering Sarah by Mooney.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: I have loved all of John Irving\\'s other books. I was excited to read this one, but I was quite disappointed. The storytelling and the plot are usual Irving style, but Ruth\\'s (the main character) relationship with Hannah as well her lovers are surprisingly superficial and unbelievable. Irving\\'s usual ironic humor is missing, and there doesn\\'t seem to be anything taking it\\'s place.\\n__label__1 At least I bought it in a sale: John Irving is a very talented storyteller which is why I bought A Widow for One Year. However, I couldn\\'t even finish (in italics) this book. I became annoyed early on when Irving describes Eddie as carrying \"a heavy duffel bag and a lighter, smaller suitcase\". Unfortunately he does this about ten (in italics) times in as many pages. After the third time I was mentally screaming \"ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET THE PICTURE. \\'LUGGAGE\\' IS OKAY NOW.\" Irving\\'s constant use of italics is also extremely (in italics) helpful. I couldn\\'t have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself. NOT. Combined with the thin and dreary plot, this work is not exactly a page turner. More of a page churner.\\n__label__1 A major disappointment from one of my favourite authors.: Although this book starts off quite promisingly and quite thrillingly I found it quickly descended into a contrived and finally uninteresting story. The plot twists were unbelievable and the characters motivations were, at times, ridiculous. Unfortunately, after the last two superb books: A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Son of the Circus, this was a major disappointment.\\n__label__1 A Widow for One Year: This has to be the most boring novel I have read. In fact, once I put it down, I found that it is virtually impossible to pick it up again. However, since I bought the book, I picked it up again, at about page 106, only to put it down again at page 232. I doubt if I\\'ll ever start again. The book stinks.\\n__label__1 A disappointment: I love John Irving. He is a funny, quirky and captivating writer who often hits me right in the centre of my heart.That\\'s the problem with this book. Its as if he is TRYING to be quirky, that he knows that is his hallmark. Instead, his characters come of seeming flawed or pathetic. The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment.\\n__label__1 Please don\\'t bother with this one: \"A Widow for One Year\" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn\\'t love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÑI found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÑby a different author.But, I hear \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" is well worth the read. However, the next Irving book I pick up will be from the library, as I can\\'t bear to spend more money on anything that has the slightest chance of being so mundane.\\n__label__1 A widow for one year - a waste of one month: When people ask me whose books I enjoy reading, the name John Irving is always first off my lips. Ever since a friend in college recommended \"Garp,\" I have been hooked by his engaging style and fascinating stories. Until now. This book bored me to tears. I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn\\'t like it - don\\'t do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels. I will be first in line for his next tome, but as for this one, it is a sad disappointment. Sorry, John.\\n__label__2 \"New\" Irving Fan: Having just read two of John Irvings books,(Cider House Rules) I am new to the phenomenon of Mr. Irving. However, I must agree with his most ardent fans, he is a wonderful storyteller. A novel that will totally submege you into the world of its characters. Even the \"weakest\" character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses. Also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book. It was so enlightening. Read it only after you finish... I have now decided that my next two Irving books will be Garp and Prayer for Owen Meaney. Both these novels have been tranformed to the \"big Screen\". Having seen Cider House on the big screen, I saw all that was missing. I am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to Irving.\\n__label__1 I knew it wouldn\\'t be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed: John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were \"best friends\" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn\\'t seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth\\'s postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much.\\n__label__1 Dull and lifeless after the first 100 pages: Mr. Irving starts off strong, with interesting well drawn characters. However, after the first section, there is nothing that\\'s either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It\\'s my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam\\'s red light district.\\n__label__2 Irvings best ever!: John Irving continually amazes me. As in all his books, I was not bored for one page. No one can create characters the way Irving can. His best ever!\\n__label__1 this was the same writer who gave us GARP?: I can\\'t believe it... GARP was such a masterpiece, and this was such drivel. Disappointing!\\n__label__1 The scenarios seemed contrived, uninteresting characters.: As this was my first Irving book, and I had heard such great things about his writing, I expected to sit back and be thoroughly entertained. No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie\\'s life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn. Drawbacks: boring, and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter Positives: At least there was some resolution of conflicts- or hint at it. Loved the ending. Clever final dialogue.\\n__label__1 Such a disappointment: It\\'s hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving\\'s forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you\\'ll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman\\'s viewpoint. No, I don\\'t believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it\\'s not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors.\\n__label__1 Not My Type: I picked up this book based on numerous good reviews on the internet, plus, john irving is a renowned writer. However, I couldn\\'t bring myself to continue reading past page 20. The characters are a bit too weird for me. I believe this is my first & last john irving\\'s book.\\n__label__1 Long winded and disappointing: I have been an avid Irving fan since I was in Jr High. I anticipate all his new arrivals with tingles. I am sure that I will laugh and cry. This time I did. Part 1 was great. I was curious about Part 2. It was all I could to finish it. Why? It totally faltered and was dull and predictable. I am afraid the creator of my all time favorite character has let me down. Next time I buy paperback and read the reviews.\\n__label__1 Dog-do: Sophomoric high school boy stuff: I detested this book. I read it for my book club and threw it away in disgust. Many of us in the club felt the same way. Trust me; there will be a bonfire when we talk about this book. How can someone write that many pages about breasts and cashmere sweaters and how jeans fit? Come on! There\\'s much more to life and people than that. The characters had no depth, no souls, and I had no desire to know them as people. At a cocktail party, if I\\'d met someone like ANY of them, I would have moved on. I prefer REAL books.\\n__label__2 1 of the 3 most memorable books of the past 10 years I read....: For those who do like real stories with real people with real passion, talent, happiness and all the bad things, which can happen to all of us. To thom, who like people out of the ordinary, those who are not perfect, but still live a valuable life. For those who appreciate people who make an impact and inspire others. Those who like high quality literature.\\n__label__2 Irving does it again: Author comes up with new ideas that keep his works exciting and new. He is one of the most creative writers I\\'ve read and weaves a tale that can grab the reader\\'s heart every time!\\n__label__2 A Widow for 600 Pages: ... this is not Irving\\'s finest work. But the great thing about Irving is that even when it\\'s not great literature it\\'s usually still a good read.The first & last act (it\\'s divided into three acts) are fabulous. The middle lulls, but just when I was about to give up on it, it became fascinating again.I give it four stars for a 5-star 1st & 3rd act and a 3-star 2nd act. ...\\n__label__1 My wife was injured by the glass: We received these glasses as a wedding gift through our registry. When washing the glasses for the first time, my wife cut her finger on a 3mm sharp spur defect protruding from the bottom inside surface of the glass. Almost invisible on casual inspection, but quite nasty to be cut by.\\n__label__1 A sad excuse for a study guide: This book is the worst study guide I have ever purchased. For that matter, it is the worst book I have ever purchased for a number of reasons. First, the book is full of typographical errors, improperly spaced sentences and poor grammar. Second, the book is printed on cheap paper and poor quality ink. The book reminds me of an old dimestore novel with the \"cheap grungy feel to it\". Third, the quality of the review material is horrible and is presented in an almost unreadable manner.I aced the Praxis 2 test this book was supposed to help with and did not see any benefit from reading or purchasing this book. Please save your money and buy another study guide. Unfortunately, I am not sure the others are any better or even available.\\n__label__1 No quality control: When I received the boat for christmas we were very excited. Mom had even thought to get an extra battery. Unfortunately when the seal was broken and the contents reviewed it was found that there was no antennae for the remote control. The slot was empty where it belonged. There were no instructions- none- and the decals were all crushed up in one corner of the box. Just for the heck of it I tried to see if it would work without an antennae but it was dead as a doornail without it. Amazon accepted it back- only option allowed was to return for refund. However may be stuck with the extra battery. What a disappointment. Very poor quality control. The boat was very cheaply made and the hinge to open the battery door felt very flimsy and had to be pried open. I certainly will not but from these people again. Recommend look for a higher end supplier.\\n__label__1 Broke after 1 week: This toy was fantastic fun - for one week. My 5 year old son loved it and was surprisingly good at controlling the boat. He did not crash it once and it zoomed around in our pond giving several hours of fun during the week we had it in the summer. However it stopped working on the 7th day (was it observing the Sabbath?) and despite replacing the battery pack it just would not work again. I tried contacting the company and asking for a replacement or a refund but they ignored me. I would not buy this boat again or deal with this company. A big fat waste of $40.\\n__label__1 Great but no antenna: I bought not 1 but 2 of these for my daughters to play with on our vacation. Easy set up,and they are sturdy. Was pleased until we got them in the water -- after going about 15 feet, the controls no longer worked. It seems that there must be an antenna problem since the boat works great up close but not at range. If this got fixed I would highly recommend the product but 15 feet isn\\'t that great a distance. Maybe I missed attaching another antenna? Has anyone else had this problem?\\n__label__1 Do NOT order from Trendy Nation!: My product has not arrived. Order was supposedly shipped a month ago! Seller will not return emails. Have filed a claim, and I hope Amazon will correct. Very disappointed!\\n__label__2 Another Great Book From Kay Hooper!: I\\'ve read a number of Kay Hooper\\'s books, and this one is just as great as every other one I\\'ve read. It\\'s got the same elements are the other works that I loved, the romance, the suspense, the action, et cetera. Once I started reading, I couldn\\'t put it down. I read the whole book in less than 8 hours. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever read anything else that Kay Hooper has written!\\n__label__2 Amazing!: I got his box for a Christmas gift and was amazed. It came with the ten complete dvds and a guide(though not really that helpful) introducing new faces(Camille Bidan,Fa Yuiry,Emma Sheen,Four Murasame,Jerid Messa and Paptimus Scirocco.) and old classics(Amuro Ray,Char\"Quattro Bajeena\" Aznable,Kai,Hyato,and Katz.). The box art was really nice so I felt like putting it on my wall! It also comes with mini figures of the Zeta Gundam,Gundam mkII,The O,Nemo,Hyaku Shiki,Asshimar,Gabthley,Messala,Palace Athene,Hizack and more. And for a good finisher, it comes with a poster of the major Zeta gundam mobile suits. If you like Newtypes,Cyber-Newtypes,Giant robo,and one gerat piece of Gundam history,get this set!\\n__label__1 inoperative: It arrived broken. I returned it, and I still haven\\'t received a refund. I will not order any reconditioned tools through Amazon.com.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t waste your time and money: I\\'ve had good luck in the past with reconditioned products-- half the power/air tools I use were purchased reconditioned/refurbished. But this nailer is not to be trusted. The first one wouldn\\'t fire a single nail. No pressure through the piston. The replacement that Amazon provided me (at no cost to me at all, thank you Amazon) fired ONE SINGLE NAIL, then started blowing by exactly like the first one. I know it\\'s not my equipment, I had to use a rental DeWalt nailer for the past week while trying to sort this out, and it worked flawlessly every day, despite looking exactly like what you\\'d expect a rental nailer to look like: that is, beat to hell.Don\\'t be afraid to buy reconditioned, just stay as far away from this nailer as you possibly can. A good start would be to not buy it in the first place.\\n__label__1 disappointed: when I recieved this nailer I hooked it up and tested it and it worked after a few tries. But when I got on the roof to shingle with it, it never shot a nail.\\n__label__2 Great Buy: This is a great deal, I recieved the gun in almost brand new condition. Fired off perfectly, put 1/3/4 nails through a 2 x 4 at 80psi. I have a 8 gallon compressor and it didn\\'t kick on until about 40 nails. I highly recommend this gun.....Factory-Reconditioned Bostitch U/RN46-1 3/4-Inch to 1-3/4-Inch Coil Roofing Nailer\\n__label__2 very good album: this album is very unique and full of folklore yet easy to listen and relax to. The seller also delivered within the specified time promised.\\n__label__2 Second step in CDMA Design and Opt.: If you know the basics of any CDMA system (IS-95, CDMA 2000,etc...), this book is going to be very useful to understand the basic design and opt. concepts related to UMTS. But if you are not familiar with DSSS basics you may get lost in the first 3 chapters.\\n__label__1 Never got product?: Odd because I got one product from seller but not another and was very satisfied. I ordered at the same time and the sent the first package and the second package never came and was delivered but returned for \"inadequate address.\"\\n__label__1 Good for adults, bad for kids.: My daughter and I looked over this and the other two books by Dr Dyer and found them to be totally useless. Most of the ideas in the books are things either totally inapplicable to children, beyond what a child can do or understand, or so basic a child already knows it.Many of the suggestions are great for adults to be reminded of, though.\\n__label__2 Inspirational!: This book is terrific. I love it and my 8-year-old daughter loves it. She has struggled with some grief issues and some self-esteem issues, and this book makes her smile every time we read it. She has even asked if we can get more books like that. I am so pleased to have her read positive things about herself and have a chance to think about why she herself is so special. Thank you, Dr. Dyer!\\n__label__2 Great product!: Have been looking for eyebrow shaper for long finally found it,it so easy to use,but u have to be careful,so that it doesn\\'t cut it,other than that its a great product\\n__label__1 Really a big letdown.: I, too, feel I must chime in and express my disappointment in this book. The subject matter is fascinating; I\\'ve been interested in End Times prophecy for quite some time. After hearing Kathleen on Art Bell\\'s show, I ordered the book eagerly. There were some major delays with the book\\'s arrival, but that\\'s another matter.The writing is of poor quality. The book\\'s production values seem to be not quite up to par. The fact that so much of the book was based on the Lueken work was the most shocking part of it all. The supply list in the back of the book smacked of hucksterism.I, too, am sorry I bought this book, and urge those who are interested in this sort of material to look elsewhere, starting with Father Malachi Martin\\'s books. Fr. Martin\\'s books will stand the test of time; this book will not.\\n__label__2 Wish I could give it more stars...: This book touched my heart and changed my life. I can\\'t thank the author enough for taking chances like this to wake people like me up.\\n__label__2 You really should buy this book!: Kathleen Keating did an awesome job in tying together the various sources on prophecy and political intrigue. Before I read the book, I had heard Ms. Keating on the radio. I did my own looking into the subject matter she had spoken about. I can tell you that she is absolutely credible. The book is interesting, but moreover, will prove an invaluable survival tool in the probable future we are racing toward.\\n__label__1 what a crock: I quote another reader\\'s review ..\"Anyone who would believe this garbage is either naive or stupid\"Faith is one thing, but being a complete SHEEP is another. This woman\\'s obvious intention is to serve her own agenda and make a buck - and you paranoid bible thumpers let her get away with it.This is a woman who sells BANNER AD SPACE on her website? Hello? \"Investigative journalist\" my @$$ .. try wallet reaver.\\n__label__1 Shoddy research: I had the displeasure of reading this book in it\\'s entirety this week. There wasn\\'t any new information here at all. The \"research\" consists of stories that can be found on any conspiracy web site on the Internet. Saying that I\\'m not impressed is about the nicest thing I can say...This book is a major disappointment. The same information can be found anywhere on the Internet, and requires no special research. Some of the information...should be viewed with a very discerning eye.Very disappointing!\\n__label__1 Unimpressive, on several levels.: That pretty much sums it up. I\\'ve seen this stuff on the web, this appears to just be a rehash without anything new and notable. The line about packing the china (which another reviewer picked up on) was hilarious. This just strikes me as a \"quick-and-dirty\" effort, more attention being paid to getting it out and making money off it than to actual content and information. Again, very unimpressive, but hey...that\\'s what reviews are all about, right? Like someone else said, SAVE YOUR MONEY.\\n__label__1 rip off:-(: This poster was horrible. I could have had my 5 yr old son draw me a better one. It was very disappointing. You should be ashamed of selling such a bad product. I wish I could have given you a zero.\\n__label__1 A weak effort: I agree this book would not have been published if Wambaugh didn\\'t already have a good track record. The plot is a variation on \"Body Heat,\" but the outcome is telegraphed so early that the only fun was seeing how the details would vary. He also seemed to be emulating \"Bonfire of the Vanities\" in early chapters, but without success. Some of the dialog made me wince.\\n__label__2 folding cane: Like the ease of use and folding. The carry case is a joke. It is not that easy to place the cane in the case. I do wish it came with a wrist strap attached. The design/color is attractive. Would recommend.\\n__label__2 Mystery entwined with history - a suspenseful, humerous teen time travel adventure: Mary Cunningham\\'s novel, Cynthia\\'s Attic: The Missing Locket, tells the story of two twelve-year-old girls, Cynthia and Gus, best friends, who embark on a startling supernatural adventure as a magical trunk in Cynthia\\'s attic propels them fifty years into the past where they encounter their grandmothers when they were twelve year old best friends.Core values of family, friendship, loyalty and love pervade this rapid fire page turning tale as Cynthia and Gus struggle to unravel dark mysteries entwining their family\\'s present and past.The tension is parlayed with humor creating a perfect mix to enthrall both teen and adult readers alike.I am an adult reader and writer who loved this book and am now enthusiastically sharing it with my daughters, ages fifteen and eleven.I look forward to reading more by this exceptional author, Mary Cunningham.Mitch Lits, author of A Little of Your Time and Dream Travelers.\\n__label__2 So much better: This product is far and away the most durable cover. It is plenty long enough and fits great. It has great anchoring so the wind doesn\\'t come underneath it and blow away. Worth the money, definitely.\\n__label__2 Motorola FR60: This is a decent 2 way radio.Pros:Works wellGood sound qualitySturdy (dropped mine several times and they still work great)They will last (had mine for probably over 5 years)Cons:On the bulky sideA bit expensiveShorter rangeBottom line:I was at Target today and saw Motorola\\'s radio, don\\'t remember what it is but it has a 4 mile range, is tiny, and was only $17.99. I would go with something more along those lines. The FR60 is a good radio, but you can get better for cheaper.\\n__label__2 very good itam: Usually i wanted to have item. so nearly i bought it in the amazon.finally reactor stove system delived to me and today i use to heat water in the M.T.very very good. i\\'m saticefied of msr.Recommend item for people to love M.T or to enjoy varity life.\\n__label__1 functional: Few chips and scratches in wood. Did not want to return because I needed it immediately. Will cover flaws with stain.\\n__label__2 They\\'re not from England!: Just to clear something up that was mentioned by another review, the Tender Idols are not from England. They are from Atlanta, Georgia.Anyway, that\\'s not really the issue. The Tenders Idols have been around for a while (check out the haggered face of the guitarist - he looks like John Lennon after Yoko had sucked the life out of him) and Distressor is their third album. It\\'s also their best, possibly because they have themselves a fairly new - and extremely talented - bassist in Joe Jones.Distressor is a mix of everything associated with Brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure. It\\'s nothing very innovative or particularly new, but it\\'s a very well produced album that is the kind of CD I like to listen to when I write. They\\'re a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon.\\n__label__1 Garage Beat: I did not think any of this collection was worth the listen. Disappointed as have heard some gems from that era but this copy did not have any for my taste.\\n__label__2 Baby\\'s buddy: My daughter loves to stare at her pooh toy. I put this on the changing table and she just looks and looks at it while I am changing her. I take it with me in the car and set it where she can see it. Boy it attracts her attention. She is still too little to hold it, but I am sure that once she is grasping things, this will be one of the first toys she holds.\\n__label__2 Taunt Rawks!!: Now Seriously Folks, the new CD from veteran punk band Taunt, contains some really good punk music. My Favorite songs are sXe, Help Me Begin and Emotions Inside. Their latest cd shows the development of a mature Taunt. If you like punk, you should definitely have this one in your collection. It is worth the money.\\n__label__2 lavek@aol.com: I really needed this cd. A bad week at work, struggles on every side, our first baby arriving in 3 weeks. Needless to say, I had a lot on my mind. The people at (...) might have wondered what I was listening to while I fought back both tears and shouts of joy. The Lord used this CD to lift me up. It helped me to put things back into perspective.\\n__label__1 Is Aleister Crowley boring? Is that possible?: It\\'s a shame that this book is so tedious, because the author knows his subject. I read Lawrence Sutin\\'s biography of PK Dick and I was impressed, so I had high hopes for this one. But there\\'s no structure to the story, no plot. Sutin moves from one moment of Crowley\\'s life to the next, never making it clear if he\\'s describing a high point, a low point, a turning point, etc. Halfway through, I promised myself I\\'d finish the book, sure that as Crowley\\'s life reached the end, Sutin would bring things to a climax. But he didn\\'t. Sutin knows the facts but didn\\'t present them in a compelling way.\\n__label__1 Beginner romance: While Wolf has written other novels that I have enjoyed, this one felt like Introduction to Historical Romance 101. The characters were not in the least complicated, nor was the story line. The language and style felt as if it were intended for a very YOUNG female audience...Nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader, but not to one with more mature sensibilities. Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I\\'d prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing.\\n__label__2 Adventure and Thoughts: Great book. Who says we have to travel to far away places for adventure? Tim Palmer had what for most of us would be a lifetime of adventures on this 9 month journey. At the same time the people he introduces us to and the observations he shares about all that he sees will make any reader think harder about our place on and responsibilities to this world.\\n__label__2 CUTE MOVIE: DORIS DAY AND GIG YOUNG WERE VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. SO WAS CLARK GABLE BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS A BIT OLD FOR THE PART.a VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE.\\n__label__2 gable does comedy!: this movie is a delight! doris day and clark gable are very funny together. he is a hard boiled newspaper man and she is a journalism teacher. together they teach each other about newspapers and love. gig young is very amusing in a supporting role. doris sings too. check this one out. you won\\'t be disappointed. happy movie watching. aloha haleiwa jon\\n__label__2 Flash back in Time: I enjoyed reading this book it took me back in the day when values, virtues and raging hormones were on a balancing scale (ha-ha)I found it wholesome,funny,and heartwarming, this generation could look back in time and realize the complexities of a teenager are still the same. I would like to see this made into a movie on the BIG SCREEN!!!!\\n__label__2 a gift for a die hard fan: he wears it to work, and he gets alot of attention so i guess it was worth buying . grear price !!!\\n__label__1 not for beginners: This product looks terrific, with a lot of games, interesting features,etc.,but very soon you will be dissappointed as the program returns you to the same place again and again. You can do nothing about this. The seller\\'s help is also useless.After 2-3 weeks of training I had to quit the program.\\n__label__1 JHIADB: What a creep. The author is a homewrecker, liar, and hypocrite. People who bought his book should get a refund and apology.\\n__label__2 revvmjones: The book was great but condition was the worst I have seen. Many pages ,upon opening the book, just fail out. So how I continued to manage reading the pages that fail out first.\\n__label__2 great relaxation CD!: Both my 4 and 6 year old both love this CD at bedtime! So sweet to hear the 4yo doing the deep breathing and telling her toes to \"go to sleep\". Works like a charm b/c they\\'re usually fast asleep 1/2 way through, and it works on me too! Sometimes we just play the soft music on repeat.\\n__label__2 Great Read: I absolutely loved this book. I couldn\\'t put it down. I haven\\'t been able to say that since the Shopaholic series! This book had great insight to trials of the modern family. I laughed, I cried, I was inspired. I highly recommend this book. As I see other reviewers think her other books is better, I will be reading it as soon as I get my hands on it.\\n__label__2 A story of life.: I enjoyed Jennifer Weiner\\'s first book `Good in Bed\\' but I loved `In her shoes\\'. This is the story of three women, Rose a lawyer who is more focus on her studies then her looks, Maggie her younger sister who is gorgeous but everything she touches becomes a disaster and Ella the estranged grandmother who can link the past to the future. I can\\'t wait for the movie!\\n__label__1 Disapointing: How can the author of Good in Bed produce such drivel? I am sorely disapointed with the sophmore release! Nothing grabbed me here, the characters are one dimensional, the plot nearly non- existant, and just generally boring. I did not feel any sympathy for any of these characters nor did I care what happened to them.If you want to read a good Weiner book, read Good in Bed again!\\n__label__2 Hard to Put Down: Jennifer Weiner has yet again writting another book that\\'s hard to put down. You can\\'t seem to help but figure out what will happen next to the two main characters, Rose and Maggie.If you are reading these reviews and trust what people are saying, pick up this book, whether you are to buy it or borrow it from a library, and you\\'ll end up devouring it. I started just this morning, and I\\'ve finished. Not once did I have to force myself to pick up this book, because it has been in my hands nonstop.\\n__label__2 In Her Shoes: Well, I\\'m actually reading this book right now, because it was recommended in this magazine I read. I\\'m reading it in hebrew, but by browsing in the author\\'s website, I can see it\\'s translated in her style, and really well - might I add.I really like the book, especially the parts with Ella. I\\'d defenatly recomend In Her Shoes.\\n__label__2 Steve Earle in 2000: Tracks included on Steve Earle\\'s live from Austin, TX in 2000 are as follows: 1. Transcendental Blues, 2. Everyone\\'s In Love With You, 3. Another Town, 4. Taneytown, 5. Hard-Core Troubadour, 6. Someday, 7. Telephone Road, 8. The Devil\\'s Right Hand, 9. More Than I Can Do, 10. I Can Wait, 11. Goodbye, 12. Steve\\'s Last Ramble, 13. Copperhead Road, 14. The Unrepentant, and 15. Christmas In Washington. This 2000 concert presents a striking contrast from Steve Earl\\'s performance in 1986 at the same venue during his \"clean cut\" days. Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.\\n__label__2 Helps Maintain Existing Strength: I\\'ve been going to the gym for about 5 years pretty consistently now. I try to get there at least 3 times a week, but during the busy holiday months that doesn\\'t always happen. I normally use muscle milk, but decided to give this a try after seeing it. While I didn\\'t really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this, I was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight I am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so I think it works pretty well. So maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains, but I really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so I would use it again.\\n__label__2 Just the best: We shopped around on the internet and decided to go with the T-Fal Fit \\'N Clean for these reasons: it has an upper and lower heating element, variable temp control, and you can put the whole unit in the dishwasher. We\\'ve found it to be everything we wanted in an indoor grill. Clean-up couldn\\'t be easier. We love it!\\n__label__1 Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project.\\n__label__1 Somewhat disappointed: After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author\\'s prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The \"romance,\" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn\\'t come.\\n__label__1 Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing: One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \"save space\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.\\n__label__1 If you are easily betrayed ...: Anyone who might believe that the men who don Mickey (or Minnie) outfits and dance around the World of Disney are all ex-college heterosexual football jocks, might also be shocked (and entertained) by this wasted \"journalism.\" Corporate America is seldom what it seems, and Disney is a corporation.\\n__label__2 If you like rice cakes, these are a great choice: Let\\'s face it, there are 2 types of people in this world: those who like rice cakes & those who don\\'t. I like these because they are vegan, not too salty, & crunchy (although they do make crumbs quite easily). So much easier to buy these in bulk. Popcorn flavor is light, but it does have more flavor than the plain ones.\\n__label__2 Zippo Lighter Fluid: Zippo fluid burns much cleaner than most others, so its far easier to keep my lighter clean. Of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid, but I personally like it (yeah yeah.. don\\'t say it). I\\'ve seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted, but mine doesn\\'t. Its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a Zippo, even being the large 12oz can.I\\'m not saying anything that others already haven\\'t, so I\\'ll end with this. If you want your Zippo to stay reasonably clean, not stink horribly, and burn consistently... get the Zippo brand. Other brands will work, just not as well.\\n__label__1 It seems to require a small tool to pop open the spout: It should let me open without any tools. Plus, there are no instructions for opening. The fuel works, of course.\\n__label__2 Good fuel: This is official brand zippo fuel, which I guess is a good thing. I\\'ve been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo, but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it. The fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister.*NOTE* When I first got this, I pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my EYE. Be careful when opening the container. Also, it comes out very fast and if you\\'re not careful will leak onto things.\\n__label__2 Zippo Refill: Bought with Zippo hand warmers, which was nice because it came with a cap to fill. Came unopened and as described, on time.\\n__label__1 Bad sets. Egyptians garbed like Catholics: What happens on the stage has none of the fun you look for. A bare-breasted woman hauling in a snake?Some Egyptian priests have on lace-fringed surpluses, looking like Catholic priests. Altar boys in the background. Women wearing crosses nestled in their cleavages?The director really screwed this one up. Listen to CDs, and use your imagination.\\n__label__1 Not so hot: Great features, not so hot. Food comes out as is if it was steamed. Trays are with in a few months already loosing there non sick coating.\\n__label__1 Not the quality you expect: Be sure to listen to a few previews before purchasing this album. My guess is that these recordings are very early versions of the original songs.\\n__label__2 Brilliant!: Many other reviewers have probably covered the plot and characters, so I won\\'t waste space by reiterating it here. I just want to say how wonderfully interesting this book was: I wasn\\'t able to put it down.I didn\\'t loathe any characters (strange for me) and had fallen in love with several of them by the end of the story. This book will not waste your time like so many others do: you will go back and reread it over and over again, just as I have.\\n__label__1 Am I missing something?: After reading all the glowing reviews for this game, I cannot believe how incredibly dull and tedious it was. I gave up in the middle of the third case. The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it\\'s a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you\\'ve got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games.\\n__label__2 Nontraditional, but entertaining.: This is, simply put, not a game for everyone. This isn\\'t a \\'shoot em up\\', or action adventure. You play the role of, duh, Phoenix Wright, a young attorney just starting out. You gather evidence, follow the leads, and question witnesses on the stand, trapping them in their own lies.If you\\'re the type who loves looking for all the details, twisted wordplay, and loves a good puzzle, this is your game. If all you\\'re looking for is mindless violence, feel free to pass.\\n__label__1 Poor Film Making at Its Finest: Bloody awful. Character actions lack motivation, logic, or explanation. Acting is brilliantly mediocre. Dialogue, what little there is between flashbacks and dream sequences, lacks punch and believability. Plot--if it can be called that--is tedious. Scenes drag on and on. It\\'s pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors\\' other film, \"Shank,\" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.\\n__label__2 Hey, thanks!: What a way to start the day. My students are having a ball listening to the songs from Dr. Jean.\\n__label__2 Great Book, A Must Buy For CFers: This book will prepare you for the exam! Thursday: 4/5/01, I started reading from page one. Saturday: 4/7/01, I was on the last page! That\\'s how smooth it is written.Ben Forta emphasized that it is not a cheat-sheet, but instead it helps with all the fundamentals of CF. I highly recommend this book for those that have some experience on their hands but need the extra assurance to pass the exam.Today: 4/10/01, I took and pass the Certified ColdFusion Developer exam! I wouldn\\'t say the book was the reason I pass, but it sure built a lot of fundamental skills and confident in me to pass.If you feel like you might pass the exam this book will make you feel even better about your skills.Xman\\n__label__1 Sorry, this item is not worth the purchase price!: Unraveling The Inner Game To Slightly Used Cars Sales Success OnlineI purchased this about 3 months ago but didn\\'t get around to listening until today. The CD has nothing to do with the used car business; it is a recording of a telephone interview which discusses motivational techniques for all business. The title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business, but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine. If you need motivation buy good motivational books available most anywhere and if you need help in used car sales this will not help you.\\n__label__2 A Wonderful book for the Diana Collector: This is a wonderful picture book for the collector of Princess Diana memorabilia. The tribute from author William Holden was touching, with various tidbits regarding his relationship with the Princess. There was a nice mixing of color photos from her private and also her public life. The pictures in this book seem to bring out the laughter and charming spirit that was the Princess Diana.\\n__label__1 Looks better than it works: Not a bad idea: two hemispheres grab enough mix to form a meatball.Problem: if the meatball mixture is really good (like from Cooks\\' Illustrated) the mix is sticky--and the two halves don\\'t let go. Even with timely dipping in water or whatever.We found a medium ice cream/cookie scoop (e.g.,OXO Good Grips Medium Cookie Scoop) works better. The rotating bail inside the scoop forces the meatball out--even if the mix is sticky.\\n__label__2 The best Playstation Game ever made.: This Game is challenging, yet not too hard to play, so I didnt find myself banging my head against the floor in anguish, trying to finish it. It was long, yet entertaining...every minute. It is the ONLY Game is the 5 years of playing games (computer & Playstation) that I will play again. As a horror fan, I loved Fatal Frame and Silent Hill and fancied Resident Evil...But now this game tops every game Ive ever played. Scary...exciting...Interesting. Controls were cool too. In the past I had a hard time with Resident evil controls; eventually catching on. I look forward to Resident evil 5, and I heard it is only going to be released on x-box 360. I may be wrong...but if it is, Im buying an x-box 360!\\n__label__2 Greatest of All Time: I actually bought this game soon as it came out for PS2 for 50 dollars. I kept puting off playing it so one day I finally sat down to play it. Wow, this game blew me away!! The graphics are the best i have seen and the Pro Logic sound makes it come alive on any surround sound system. A great purchase for me and hopefully any PS2 owner.\\n__label__2 the prequal to resident evil nemesis: I just started this game and it is a lil\\' so to get started and a little difficult to get going and the zombie\\'s are kinda tuff to kill cause they can throw there AX\\'s and they have dinomites. I have yet to see the first boss which is a big fish with a big mouth. this game is slow to get started but i will see how good it is at the end.\\n__label__2 Quick service: I damaged my S60 and needed a replacement. This fit the bill perfectly, both in cost and quick service. No problems with the camera.\\n__label__1 There are better books...: I thought this would be cute for my toddler because he loves books and we\\'re starting to get into potty training. The quality of the board book isn\\'t great and the content is even worse. There are definitely better books out there for children, but I thought I\\'d give it a try because the price was right. I won\\'t bother returning it, but I wouldn\\'t recommend it.\\n__label__2 Really cute: The little ernie is so cute and my daughter loves telling him not to use \\'too much toliet paper\\'. Good strong board book as well which is what every kid in this age group needs.\\n__label__1 Too Short and not visual enough!: It\\'s not worth your money. Poorly written. Looks that sales of it rely on the known character Erni. Good marketing.\\n__label__1 Potty Book for 2-1/2 year old son: I bought this book for my son to read while potty training, he enjoys it but it is extremely vague in the actual process of what goes into the potty training process. For example it skips from Ernie got a new potty to when Ernie \"has to go\" he sits on the potty and \"goes\". I pretty much don\\'t even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son, I will read it \"when Ernie has to pee-pee or poopie\". I would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child, but as I said my son does enjoy looking at it.\\n__label__1 Unimpressed: I didn\\'t find this very encouraging. The wording was unimpressive and the only draw was the baby Ernie.\\n__label__1 flimsy, not informative: First off, the board book pages are thiner than most board books. I have little boys and they\\'re really hard on stuff. We had this book for 2 weeks before the pages got bent in half.Second, I didnt like the fact that ernie used WAY to much toilet paper. The day after we read this book I found my bathroom covered in toilet paper. Yeah the probably would have done that anyway, but the book didnt help the situiation. Not a huge fan of the new Sesame Street.\\n__label__2 Great hard core punk band: The Gotohells are a great punk band. I first heard them on the cd, \"five years on the streets,\" since then I have been a huge fan. They have so much energy and I would recomend this cd for anyone punk fan.\\n__label__2 Another Hit by Maxted: I fell in love with Anna Maxted novels after reading Getting Over it, Running in Heels, and Behaving Like Adults.A Tale of Two Sisters is a novel about two Jewish sisters Lizbet and Cassie growing up in London and dealing problems related to trying to get pregnant.The main plot of this book is about about pregnancy,adoption, the people you will always love, and those you fall out of love with.I started this book on a Saturday morning and didn\\'t put it down until that night, a definite read!\\n__label__1 a lot of noise, but not much music: Slow going, this movie hardly managed to keep my attention. It plays a lot like a made-for-TV film. And yet, the movie contains a great monologue by its main character about what heaven and hell are and how it\\'s the summation in our brain\\'s reactions to our entire lives that determines the way we spend our eternity.\\n__label__2 SPECIAL: NOW, NOW, NOW! In this age of hi-tech and instant gratification it is not proper to restore [retouch] everything to pristine quality [imagine tampering with the Mona Lisa because it looks too drab!]. Sure this DVD has flaws [the horrid Anglo dubbing should go - keep the original French and give us subtitles]. However, this is pure nostalgia, the flavor and essence of Piaf and her amours [the breathtaking Marcel, cut in his prime] - then Theo.Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Jean Marais, Cocteau, Romy Schneider, Alain Delon, Jean Paul Belmondo, etc. we get glimpses of the not so distant past - this is a perfect mood piece, instead of an \\'in your face\\' documentary.A must have for the serious collector.\\n__label__1 For devoted fans only: This DVD should be viewed by devoted fans only and preferably French speaking fans at that. The picture quality is extremely poor, the appearances of Piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius. It\\'s dedinitely not one for the average viewer!\\n__label__1 Big dissappointment: Essentially, the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this DVD in English (which is the only option.)Subtitles would have done the trick nicely, enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them. When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf\\'s words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available.\\n__label__1 Cybershoot DSCS90: I\\'ve been a Sony fan as long as I remember, but this product is the worst Sony ever made.Picture qulity is bad, it won\\'t take a high capacity memory stick, it\\'s big and heavy.I\\'m looking for a diffrent camara now and this one is going to be my little girl toy.\\n__label__1 Stay far far far away from SONY!!!: Ok, so we got this camera about 3 years ago and paid $150-ish. We take pictures once maybe twice a year (and NO more than a 100 total so far). Well I needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what... it\\'s dead! It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago, but nothing else... it instantly shuts right back off.Better yet, after an hour of internet research, apparently several people have had this problem... so I dug out my old SONY camera. It took two good pictures and then the picture/video card fried! It literally started trembling in my hand.I\\'m done with Sony... last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too. This used to be the best quality company around, now they\\'ve obviously turned to crap.\\n__label__2 Great Condtioner!: This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair. The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy. I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates it\\'s products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair. I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!\\n__label__2 Good Mystry with value: Good read, along with personal values and dedication...I so enjoyed the mystery and about reaading something that is not the usual time, place and characters..\\n__label__2 Good beginning to a great series: Joe Pickett isn\\'t your average hero. He\\'s a game warden trainee who becomes involved in a murder when a local outfitter\\'s body appears in his woodpile. The plot concerning greedy business interests versus a thought-to-be-extinct mammal in Wyoming\\'s beautiful wilderness is familiar, but the characterizations are great. Joe is a courageous yet flawed hero; his wife, Marybeth, is loving yet headstrong. What happens to the characters in this novel is reflected in their emotional growth over the next books in the series and often has devastating consequences. A great read.\\n__label__2 Good First book: Even though you could tell this was a first of a series with a little disjointed story to start, it quickly picked up and was a very fun read. It kept my interest through out and the end threw some great twist. I recomend this and have already bought the next two in the series.\\n__label__2 Pretty good first book!: Started off a little slow for me but once it picked up I couldn\\'t put it down. I am purchasing book number two tonight!\\n__label__1 Skip this one, even if you like the VSI series: This book is neither very short nor a proper introduction. In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest \"Teach Yourself Linguistics\" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics. Also check out the excellent audio/video linguistics courses offered by \"The Teaching Company.\"\\n__label__2 still going strong: I liked this season as much as the two earlier ones. It is fun to watch the new twists on the Merlin legend.The only weak episode (for me that is) is the goblin episode. But again it is unrealistic to expect all episodes to be perfect.\\n__label__1 Terrible Quality Control: I ordered Season 3. The discs came scratched up. One wouldn\\'t read properly. I got another one sent. Same thing. Discs scratched up worse than the first on some of them. One disc won\\'t read properly. The worst scratched disc in both sets is disc 5, although 3 was scratched in both sets as was 4. Either the manufacturer is messing up or the case they\\'re in is messing up the discs.The same thing happened with Merlin Season 2. I had to order twice because the first set was scratched. The second one was ok. So out of 4 ordered, only 1 set was non-scratched.I like the show. But these DVD sets are junk. I\\'d only buy the next ones locally so I could keep returning it until I get a good set.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: Although shipping on this item was very fast, my little one was very disappointed when the product didn\\'t work. Sadly, we are sending it back.\\n__label__1 material quality not provided: I purchased two of of the bollard single hook bath room accessories and expected a full quality product. The basic unit meet my expectations with non rusting materials and a chrome finish. However the set screws provided were simple carbon steel. If used, these set screws would soon rust and the product and the tile floor would be stained. I had to purchase stainless steel set screws to assemble and install the units.\\n__label__1 Buyer Beware: I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode \"Imprint\" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It\\'s bad enough they said they\\'d never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense.\\n__label__1 Slow: If you are upgrading and your file size is large, I would buy something else. It takes forever to print. I talked to tech support and they know there is a problem and are trying to fix it. This is not acceptable. The 2006 version has a different database than the prior versions, and it has made the file much larger and for some much slower. I had to buy a new version because I use their payroll services and my 2003 is being fazed out April 30. I have just now bought the 2005 an Ebay. After printing the audit trail, I was able to record all my transactions while in the 2006 version onto my restored 2003 version and then upgraded to 2005. I know this seems like alot of work, but the 2006 was that bad for me.\\n__label__1 Buy a hot dog for a $1 and pay $1.25 every year for the bun: Quickbooks may be an excellent small business software package, but I will never know. The ads and discription imply it has a payroll program included in it. Surprise - not only can you not run payroll, the cost of the single payroll module is more than the A/R, A/P, G/L,Inventory, reports,and tracking package you just paid for. But wait - you have the privledge of paying EVERY YEAR. I was going to switch from Peachtree but at least in PT you can (it is very obtuse and cumbersome)make the tax changes manually. PS. 1 copy of Quickbooks will be on ebay soon.\\n__label__1 Sign me up for the class action \\'sunset clause\\' lawsuit! when it comes: Imagine you buy a new GM car but after 3 years onstar sends a signal to your onboard computer to self destruct! oh sure you can still sit in your car and smell it and look at it and listen to the radio but you sure can\\'t drive it! Thats the sunset \\'policy\\' intuit enforces! after 3 years you cant use your software for any *real* productivity. No one does this, even with windows you can still use windows 95 or 3.1 and still have the full functionality you paid for. But to take away functions paid in full (not on lease or rent mind you) that is total 100% theft!!!!!!!!!!!!I am ashamed I choose to talk myself into upgrading for other reasons, namely 2003 required many more keystrokes on the register than the simple quicken I used before 2003. so 2006 finally got me back to the ease of quicken usage despite the fact that 2006 would not register until after talking to Hashish in India for an hour!!!\\n__label__2 Love the changes: I did not belive it could get more user friendlyIf you have a small business it is the only accounting for you\\n__label__1 In the year 2006 I should not to hack registry hives: In the year 2006 it is INSANE that we as IT pros still have to hack registry hives to get this software to run as a limited privilege account to better secure our computers.QuickBooks Community - Running QuickBooks 2005 as a Restricted User (Admin Rights FIX):[...]When will quickbooks begin to code in a secure manner? Peachtree does. Microsoft Small Business Accounting does.Why does Intuit require updates every few years and acts like we are still all running Windows 98 machines?Security is important these days. How about stepping up to the plate Intuit and getting with the other vendors?\\n__label__1 Cleaner two: 2 1/2Too flimsily short for its own good, some of these sonic subtleties do contain interlocking textures of interest.\\n__label__2 Tears of Joy: I can not remember how I found this book online but I am glad I did. I highly recommend this book for anyone who may have a million and one questions about their own faith. It gives you a new perspective and WANTING to pray to God at night because you know he hears you.There are so many good stories that I want to highlight but I would not give them the justice it deserves, so all I want to say today is to please purchase this book. I am so glad God creates different types of people, with different types of stories because it brings us all closer together.\\n__label__1 Won\\'t lay flat: Kept bowing out from the garage door no matter how tight I tried to keep it flush. Finally took it down and installed a more study product.\\n__label__2 Good Advice: Bought this for my sister as a gift upon starting Med school. She found it enjoyable and said it helped to have a little different perspective along the way.\\n__label__2 just like in Costa Rica: I loved drinking coffee in Costa Rica and it is fun to be able to have it in the house.\\n__label__2 Ty Beanie Babies Blue Lizzard: My son was very happy with this product. It was just as it appeared, good quality etc.\\n__label__2 Ms. Neggers does it again!: I am a fairly recent reader of Carla Neggers\\' work. When I first picked up one of her books, I quickly found as many of her past works as possible in my favorite used book store. Once read; I had to wait anxiously for her next book. I wasn\\'t disappointed in her latest, Dark Sky. It was an exciting, nail biting adventure. Although I was able to figure out who the \"bad guy\" was fairly early on; it was still a great book to get lost in! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic suspense.\\n__label__1 JLO GETTING TO OLD-O?: I am so sorry, but she has no talent! Its her Butt who gets the glameur! She is too old! A girl on TV even called her a HOE! But that\\'s not my idea, she is just to OLD AND NOT TALENTED!\\n__label__1 Pretty disappointing.: I\\'ve been a long time fan of -ziq. I don\\'t know about anyone else, but take a quick hit from Lunatic Harness/Brace Yourself, and then put this on. There is no comparison. Much of this cd just seems like the regular \"its crazy electronic music/madness style\" filler. No substance, little originality at this point.\\n__label__1 not the original or the real the mopeds or mopes: Well, once again proving that fine musicianship does not a great rock band make... these scandinavian mopeds have layed down more slick and clever tracks to the dismay of us crazy real raw rock and roll lovers. Just compare these poppy new wave-ish tracks to the bruteish intelligence of the \"real\" mopeds also known as the mopes. An electric duo from the east coast usa broke up in 1987, blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. You can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3\\'s( www.themopes.com ) and compare for yourself. The old dive bar heroes or these newer well meaning popsters?\\n__label__1 Oww! My ears!: I believe this is the worst CD I\\'ve ever heard. Paul wrote some great songs, and I even like a half-dozen or so of his singles, from the 50\\'s to the 70\\'s. But what record company exec, in his right mind, could green-light this awful album?The 18-49 crowd will find it absolutely laughable, and Paul\\'s core audience (50\\'s and up) will just scratch their heads and say, \"What the....?\"There are two laugh-out-loud songs on this CD. Trust me, I played it for several people, and the reaction was unanimous. \"Mr. Brightside\" and \"Against the Wind.\" Did Bob Seger actually okay this? What is he smoking these days?Again, can\\'t figure out A) who would buy this, and B) who could possibly find it good.A friend gave it to me as a \"gag.\" And I just about did.Paul, thanks for your good work back in the day. But please, stop the madness. Your reputation is at stake.\\n__label__1 Out takes from \"Rock Swings\": This was a very disappointing follow up to Rock Swings. Rock Swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes, and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation. I was hoping for another helping, but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn\\'t make it on Rock Swings. The only one that could have made it that first album is the first track \"Time After Time,\" and after that it all goes tragically down hill.\\n__label__1 Come on Paul. You are a Legend. You can do better.: I am a huge fan of Paul Anka and he surely has created some of the best songs of the last century. HOWEVER this album is soo boring. It could put me to sleep were it not so pretentious. Anka\\'s got the voice and the songs could have been well covered, but the jazzy style he gives to songs such as Against the WInd or Ordinary World is just intolerable.Sorry Mr. Anka. Better luck next time.\\n__label__1 Piece of Junk: The product arrived damaged, not from shipping damage, but from packing at the factory. Too damaged to use. Dealer said they didn\\'t want it back. It\\'s a good thing, because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn\\'t run. I took the fan unit (which wan\\'t damaged) out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs, but only at a low fan speed. Anything higher causes too much vibration noise. Also, both units we received were poorly finished, with the base being several shades lighter than the cover, which matches the picture on the box. It looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain. Thanks to the dealer who refunded our money. My email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response.\\n__label__1 Had some problems: We had this humidifier for 21 days before it quit working. Before that it worked great, the humidity in our home was more comfortable. However, Amazon made it no problem and sent us a new one in about 4 days. We\\'ll see how this one last. Amazon was great in dealing with them.\\n__label__1 Essick Humidifier - Poor Quality: As several other reviewers discovered, this product (Essick Air 696-400 humidifier) is lacking in quality. The cabinet is flimsy, the unit is noisy, and the wick is a disaster! Poor engineering from the word GO.The variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds. This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!\\n__label__2 Funny-looking Substitute for the Real Thing: This is a fun-loving item for those that miss having the real bird where they might be residing at the present time(e.g.- vacationing for a long time)!\\n__label__1 Very noisy, at least the unit I received: I guess there must be something wrong with the unit I received, since pretty much everyone else gave this a good review.For me this box had an extremely high noise floor. Actually, it created the same hiss even when I turned Drive and Gain all the way down. So I sent it back.I am one of very few people who report this problem about the TubePre, which is why I suspect that there might be a small number of defective boxes out there.Too bad, it looked good on paper, I liked the VU display and had been looking forward to experimenting with different tubes.I ordered the VTB-1 instead, I hope that is going to work for me.\\n__label__2 Great Product (but arduous to clean): We bought this product, as part of our Dr. Weil \\'8 Weeks to Optimum Health\\' regimen. And, we really love it. During the winter, when the bedroom gets so dry, the humidifier really does the trick. And, it may be in our heads, but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house.This product has great air quality ratings (HEPA, etc.) relative to other products in its price range, and was easy to set up, etc.Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. You need to take it all apart, etc. However, this may be the case with all of these products, and thus, may just be par for the course.We recommend this product whole-heartedly.\\n__label__2 Lightly Scented and so gentle: My Tibetan Terrier is sixteen and she has allergies, including respiratory ones. She is also allergic to oatmeal in shampoos; none in this one. I have to bathe her frequently to remove pollen and dust. The scent is light and doesn\\'t make her sneeze or cough, and it doesn\\'t irritate her eyes. It would be better if it had no scent, but I am very happy with this product.\\n__label__2 Great workout - production not so great: I am really enjoying this DVD, but very disappointed in the music production. There are too many empty gaps of no music at all while working out. You have to keep walking while waiting for someone to start the music up again. I find this really frustrating. Leslie\\'s wonderful personality makes up for the lack of good production.\\n__label__2 It\\'s fun and works great: I\\'m 63 and love to walk but with the Montana winters I am limited. This DVD is even better than walking so come spring, I\\'ll do both. I have already lost inches in the first month, although I have yet to lose weight. But I feel better and my backaches are less every day. In fact, I feel the difference when I don\\'t do at least 1 mile in the morning before work.\\n__label__2 deadman wonderland: i love it because it is a really good anime. I got it for my friend for christmas. she really love it to.\\n__label__2 Great set and cover art but is not uncensored!: The product is great I enjoy watching this one. It is a little paranormal/science fiction/horror/fantasy/action/drama/romance/suspense. I love my dead man wonderland set. But it is not uncensored not completely. The introduction is not uncut and there are scenes that are not fully uncut. I should know I have seen some of the uncut episodes online. Overall 4 stars.\\n__label__2 Nice book - Gets to the point fast. .. like the PDA section: This book explain the how-tos very clearly. I specially like the section on PDAs.Overall I found the book very useful.\\n__label__2 Ginger Drink: a real discovery!: I tasted the Ginger Drink in the form of tea on a recent trip to visit a son and daughter-in-law in Ljubljana. It seemed very restorative and I was pleased to order some from the website he furnished and get it so quickly. If I happened to have an upset stomach or a cold, it would be even better. Very bracing!\\n__label__2 A true treasure with a colorful look: Not only is this bear huggable, kissable and pretty; it is also a true treasure. Unique in its own way, with a different array of colors for each individual bear. Great for kids who are allergic to loose fur found on most plush toys. This bear has a material so soft, so smooth and has a great clean feeling. It is also a true collectible.\\n__label__1 nother piece of junk: really disappointed by this product..to actually get the spray you have to really ramp up pressure so the plants are wiped out by the pressure..stupid set up..could a part be missing?\\n__label__1 Great Camera, but storage isn\\'t: Great camera. Great pictures. But -- the storage is terrible! A floppy disk can hold only so many images... AND it\\'ll hold only ONE megapixel image. There are better soloutions out there. CompactFlash cards can hold 64MB of images, at the least. Iomega Clik! for Digital Cameras drives can hold 40MB of imagery. And, floppy disks are expensive. I highly reccomend this for novices, but for serious photographers, stay away!\\n__label__2 Friendly, easy to use and convenient camera: If you are looking for a convenient, smart and easy to use camara. This is it, while resolution is not as good as other camaras, if you need it for web applications its good enough. One very good feature, at least for me, is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is the fact that it stores in floppy disks. This is a convenient storage media and while the storage capacity is not big, they are so cheap you can buy as many as you need. Overall I\\'m very happy with it, I strongly recommend it.\\n__label__1 sony service sucks: the camera itself has excellent features , the pictures are fair in conparison with other cameras priced hundreds less (olympus d-450 zoom and others) but the best feature is easy downloads that can be e-mailed directly out.\\n__label__1 Much too light in color: Lovely bracelet if you like a clear look with a hint of color. The picture presented is clearly showing a light color of aquamarie. The bracelet received looks clear.\\n__label__2 Fascinating: I would have to recommend this movie to people who enjoy atypical yet thought-provoking movies. It is different and not for people not willing to think outside the box. This is a movie about friendship, love, loss, sadness, and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked. This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are \"best friends,\" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? \"You are my best friend. You are my only friend.\" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another.\\n__label__2 great deal: This is my second projector and first Viewsonic. It is small, compact, and delivers a great picture. Very pleased with my projector, much better than getting a wide screen tv.\\n__label__1 Does not perform as stated and implied, and will smoke you out rather than leave you smokeless!: This item was an exciting idea, but it stopped there. After receiving 2 of these items, both were tried and very little, if any smoke made it to the filter, even when holding a cigarette within an 1/8 of an inch from the intake. Usage of this item even as only a simple ashtray is not possible as the holders are so small that any cigarette of normal size does not fit.The item is made of what is clearly the cheapest materials and it shows in the workmanship. The plastic housing, wiring, battery cap and filter are reminiscent of that cheap 1 or 2 dollar toy car with lights one finds and discount stores.The practical application of this \"smokeless\" ashtray will leave you smoked out, and frustrated, with only a waste of your time and money.\\n__label__1 Seems that they have 2 mango varieties: A few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the Mariani Phillipine Mango & I had been hooked! I was excited when I saw that Amazon sold it in bulk, when the order arrived & I opened a bag, I was so disappointed. The variety Amazon carries is the \"Mariani Thailand Mango\" and the one I went crazy for was the \"Mariani Phillipine Mango\" there was a HUGE difference in taste & texture. Now I\\'ll have to see who wants the 11 unopened bags I have :( At least I can buy the ones I like at my local Jewel Food Store.\\n__label__1 Awful, blanched, tasteless and hard.: I can\\'t believe they actually sent this to me labeled as food...I am presently researching a means of returning this product./n__label__1 Goes \"Haywire\" Regularly: Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I\\'m off to buy an Epson!\\n__label__2 Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it.\\n__label__1 Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.\\n__label__1 worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!\\n__label__1 Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2.\\n__label__1 LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn\\'t figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!\\n__label__1 What did I watch?: So he\\'s a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don\\'t know why I continued to watch.\\n__label__2 Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there\\'s more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?\\n__label__2 If you can\\'t make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I\\'m so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (\"Welcome to Mongolia!\" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.\\n__label__1 Banal and Boring: No, I\\'m not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say \"nearly,\" because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I\\'m not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...\\n__label__2 GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it\\n__label__2 Amazing Score.: Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild\\'s work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!\\n__label__1 Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don\\'t get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it.\\n__label__2 Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.\\n__label__1 It\\'s too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of \"dummie\" and \"KISS\" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn\\'t gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste.\\n__label__2 Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.\\n__label__1 awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I\\'ve tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can\\'t find packaging.\\n__label__2 Good grill for the money.: I\\'ve been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I\\'ve used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.\\n__label__1 Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn\\'t agree more w/ Prendergast\\'s review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called \"classic\" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me.\\n__label__2 entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.\\n__label__2 one more positive note: Don\\'t know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author\\'s comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.\\n__label__1 Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don\\'t buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they\\'ll get a clue.\\n__label__2 This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980\\'s: This is probably Mel Gibson\\'s first film. A film he\\'s done while he was in his 20\\'s. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \"The Road Warrior.\" And \"The Road Warrior\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980\\'s.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.\"Mad Max\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the \"action hero\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.\\n__label__2 Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I\\'ve seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there\\'s a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you\\'ve seen this movie in the past and thought, \\'It was OK\\' this new DVD will have you saying, \\'It was great!\\'\\n__label__1 AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!\\n__label__2 Oh, my God! It\\'s Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles\\' eerie song \"Revolution 9\" from the \"White Album.\" I could\\'ve just imagined while listening to \"Baby Lulu\" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I\\'ve ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you\\'re at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)\\n__label__2 Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel\\'s wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don\\'t reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!\\n__label__2 Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.\\n__label__2 Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!\\n__label__2 Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.\\n__label__2 Well Played Kid\\'s Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it\\'s own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won\\'t drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own.\\n__label__1 Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I\\'ll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!\\n__label__2 well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn\\'t put it down! if u haven\\'t read it yet, do so!\\n__label__1 Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.\\n__label__2 Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual \"guide.\" The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it\\'s pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!\\n__label__2 These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, \"Merrills are a hug for the feet.\" Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them.\\n__label__2 Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I\\'ve read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America\\'s relations to it.\\n__label__2 Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer\\'s masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn\\'t disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet\\'s Carmen and a small handful of others, I\\'m not a great opera fan but Schreker\\'s output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.\\n__label__2 Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before\\n__label__2 You\\'ll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny\\'s interpretations of the Beatles\\' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don\\'t mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It\\'s light and it\\'s fun. It\\'s is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you\\'ll get a big kick out of this disc.\\n__label__2 Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of \"Lament\" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song \"Beuonos Aires\" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.\\n__label__2 EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas\\'s accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.\\n__label__1 Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP\\'s support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.\\n__label__2 A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.\\n__label__1 A small leak, right out of the box: I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn\\'t take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this.\\n__label__1 Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it\\'s inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed.\\n__label__2 It\\'s a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it\\'s firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties.\\n__label__2 Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it\\'s a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it\\'s like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.\\n__label__2 comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone.\\n__label__1 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.\\n__label__2 Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!\\n__label__2 Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.\\n__label__1 Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for > 7 years.\\n__label__1 It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress.\\n__label__1 Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won\\'t close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can\\'t inflate the mattress. Very poor quality.\\n__label__2 Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.\\n__label__1 WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON\\'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM.\\n__label__1 Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We\\'ve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I\\'m very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it\\'s clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is \"save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on\", that\\'s what we\\'re doing now.\\n__label__2 Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!\\n__label__1 Disappointed but shouldn\\'t be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there\\'s hope.\\n__label__2 Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.\\n__label__2 Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I\\'m sure it will be used again.\\n__label__2 Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don\\'t have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.\\n__label__2 Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn\\'t have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn\\'t get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it\\'s very comfortable. It\\'s easy to inflate and deflate.\\n__label__2 Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn\\'t want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.\\n__label__2 Its better then a \"normal\" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did\\'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I\\'m still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.\\n__label__1 Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.\\n__label__2 Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.\\n__label__2 great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.\\n__label__1 Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn\\'t think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela\\'s.\\n__label__1 Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can\\'t use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.\\n__label__2 The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone\\'s place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself\\n__label__2 Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.\\n__label__2 Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you\\'re looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!\\n__label__2 Step\\'s Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD \"Standing Room Only.\" \"I\\'m So Glad\" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a \"must buy\" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.\\n__label__2 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn\\'t get the best air so I\\'d recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]\\n__label__2 DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.\\n__label__1 Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don\\'t think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.\\n__label__2 good: It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!\\n__label__1 Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY\\n__label__1 No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.\\n__label__1 Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that\\'s the part that goes on you clit. I\\'m almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I\\'ve tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.\\n__label__2 GREAT prodct: For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I\\'ve never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It\\'s a little large, and kinda hard but that\\'s okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.\\n__label__1 Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.\\n__label__1 Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don\\'t think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.\\n__label__1 Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the \"bunny ears\" cause more pain than pleasure. I don\\'t recommend this product.\\n__label__1 HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!\\n__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn\\'t jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum \"my first vibrator\" hahaha!It\\'s really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more \"lifted\" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!\\n__label__2 After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You\\'ll definitely get your money\\'s worth from this album. And even though it\\'s over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.\\n__label__1 I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It\\'s pretty, but I don\\'t expect it to hold up.\\n__label__2 Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.\\n__label__2 Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD\\'s) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her \"dialouges\" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like \"Evergreen\" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), \"The Music of the Night\" , & \"Somewhere\" (not favorable with Il Divo)\\n__label__1 Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...\\n__label__1 misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the \"too good to be true\" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.\\n__label__1 Waste of money: If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I\\'m forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!\\n__label__1 What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.\\n__label__1 Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that\\'s all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can\\'t see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 \"generations\" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.\\n__label__1 Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I\\'ve tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.\\n__label__2 Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don\\'t know how they were liked.\\n__label__2 Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn\\'t have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.\\n__label__1 Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.\\n__label__2 A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn\\'t like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn\\'t already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it\\'s beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.\\n__label__1 RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn\\'t for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn\\'t understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!\\n__label__1 Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It\\'s great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.\\n__label__1 How do films like this get made?: If this isn\\'t the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That\\'s it!\\n__label__1 What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer\\'s uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don\\'t get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!\\n__label__1 Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don\\'t really like it, myself. I think it could be better.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: I\\'m glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can\\'t choose my color I don\\'t want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn\\'t lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!\\n__label__1 no color, no buy: I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I\\'d end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!\\n__label__2 Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello\\'s other albums and, in my opinion, doesn\\'t hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey\\'s style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!\\n__label__1 Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter\\'s pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? \"Mom - it\\'s really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!\"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library\\'s collection! (I won\\'t....I\\'ll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg\\'s out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won\\'t give it 5 stars any more!\\n__label__1 A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren\\'t really Manson \"in his own words\" but were nothing more than fabrication.\\n__label__1 MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,\"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he\\'s milked you for two books.. he\\'s a good crook.\"The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.\\n__label__1 Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie\\'s own words, you\\'re mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his \\'friend\\'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don\\'t buy it.\\n__label__1 REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said \"man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system\" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n__label__2 I couldn\\'t put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn\\'t put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.\\n__label__1 sadly predictable: If you don\\'t like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don\\'t mind the writer\\'s technique or don\\'t see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.\\n__label__1 Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!\\n__label__1 Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However \"Hope\" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.\\n__label__2 A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.\\n__label__2 A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.\\n__label__2 One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing \"object\" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read\\n__label__2 GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I\\'ve been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON.\\n__label__2 Great space heater!: It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it.\\n__label__2 Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of \"Portrait of a Marriage\" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA\\'s library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call \"The Three V\\'s.\" The three V\\'s are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.\\n__label__1 Buyer Beware!!: If I\\'d only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn\\'t from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!\\n__label__1 This will be an additional toy for next spring\\'s yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn\\'t wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don\\'t...you\\'ll save your self some money and frustration.\\n__label__1 Worst scanner I\\'ve owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I\\'ve ever worked with. The \"auto\" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.\\n__label__2 a childhood favorite: In \"The Greengage Summer\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.\\n__label__2 Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320: This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you\\'re pre 10.2.X on a Mac you\\'ll have to visit Iogear\\'s website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn\\'t have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market.\\n__label__2 Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book\\n__label__2 Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the \"natural disaster\" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character\\'s individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too\\n__label__2 Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy.\\n__label__1 complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box.\\n__label__1 bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)\\n__label__1 does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?\\n__label__1 Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative\\'s players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn\\'t expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.\\n__label__1 Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap.\\n__label__1 Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I\\'ve also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i\\'m wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (\"limited\" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider \"fixing\", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would\\'ve given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I\\'m outright angry that I\\'m not alone.\\n__label__2 Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don\\'t have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as \"Discontinued\". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs\\' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.\\n__label__2 Works Great So Far: Very simple and good looking coffee bean grinder.Pros:1. Compact size2. Looks good3. Easy to UseCons:1. I wish the cable was a bit longer2. The measurement for 4 people coffee bean level is a bit hard to read. I like to grind as few beans as possible, since I am the only one drinking coffee at home, and I have some trouble estimating how much to grind.\\n__label__2 Great product: The hands free is wonderful and it is much quieter than the push down button one we had before. Much easier to clean.\\n__label__1 Design is flawed.: If you grind a lot of coffee, over time you will realize that the rotation of the grinders is in the same direction as you slide the cover to remove it. The result is, that you will have to physically hold the top to the base when you grind beans.After a little over four years, the motor of the older model of this unit burned out.I should have never gotten rid of my Krups grinder.\\n__label__1 Unevenly grinds beans: This grinder does not work well if you use a French press to make coffee. It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the \"Percolator\" (coarsest) setting. When you brew the coffee the fine dust goes right through the metal filter and ends up in your cup.On the plus side, it is easy to clean and maintain. It may work fine if you use paper filters.\\n__label__1 Unreliable: First thing in the morning, while I\\'m still waking up and maybe a tad groggy, the last thing I want is a finicky coffee grinder. I bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months, when it started working only some of the time. Some days it would work righty off the bat, and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled, usually 2 or 3 times... unplugging it every time for safety. This added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning. It got to be so annoying that I put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee. When that ran out, the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again, and this time it didn\\'t work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled. Now I\\'m in the market for a new coffee grinder.\\n__label__1 Bought this grinder with great expectations.: It was supposed to do all the things my old grinder did and more. I took it out of the box and ........... nothing. It didn\\'t ever work, period. Very disappointing. Is there a rating lower than one star. If there was, I would use it.\\n__label__2 Not for arachnophobes!: The Hobbit is no Spiderman or Battlefront (the attacks are two buttons) and the graphics are only ok. But its just fun for the ride. The hardest things in the game are not the villains but the adventure challenges. You play as Bilbo Baggins through Hobbiton, through the dark goblin caves and troll caverns, all the way to the Dragon Smaug. The graphics are very in-your-face, however (Being an arachnophobe, I nearly fell off my chair when a spider jumped out at me!). I admit, if you are into adventure games with a little more action, I reccomend the Lord Of The Rings games or The Chronicles Of Narnia: Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe. It doesn\\'t have too much action, especially at the beginning. This is the perfect game to get into gaming with, it\\'s short and sweet.And if you are a serious gamer, get this for your PC as well.\\n__label__2 Awesome: I got this CD off Amazon last Christmas and it\\'s something I\\'ve listened to throughout the year. I would highly recommend any music on the Glass Armonica, and Dean Shostak certainly makes a go of it.\\n__label__2 Tells the Truth About the Ukrainian Genocide of the Poles: During World War 2, Ukrainian-fascist-nationalists (the UPA, the so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army), imitating the German Nazis, murdered over 100,000 Polish civilians in the most brutal manner imaginable. After collaborating with the Germans in the genocide against the Jews in 1942, the Ukrainian nationalists abandoned German service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless Polish civilians. Children were impaled on stakes, and adults were quartered, etc. This was no \"liberation of the Ukraine\", as Ukrainians had voluntarily co-existed with Poles for centuries on territories which had possessed a mixture of Poles and Ukrainians for centuries, if not from antiquity.\\n__label__2 Love this show!: Love this show! So sad that the series is now over. I have been watching since Season 1 and this show is one of my favorites. I love Parker and how quirky she is.\\n__label__2 great: I love to watch this show, It Is funny as hell. There is never a moment where I regret buying it.\\n__label__2 I hope they return.... The \"Modern Day Robin Hood\\'s\": Absolutely loved all the episodes... Each one of the group has their own speciality. Mostly learned using those gifts as criminals... but now they are like Modern Day \"Robin Hood\\'s\"... They help those who can not help themselves in the way that is needed. I love all the characters and have watched all Seasons... and will miss them terribly if they do not continue the series...\\n__label__2 My sides hurt after reading this: I understand the point of this \"sting\" manuscript. However, all the serious stuff to the side, this is the funniest thing I\\'ve ever tried to read. I could only take it a few pages at a time, otherwise I started laughing so hard, I couldn\\'t focus on the page.Anyone who has ever thought about writing or publishign a book should pick up a copy of Atlanta Nights.\\n__label__1 KC light covers: This item was misrepresented. It shows in the picture that the letters are small, but when we received them, the KC letters took up the entire surface. I was very disappointed, as was my son when he opened them for Christmas.\\n__label__2 Seems to work and smells great: I purchased this protective spray after I bought a curling wand. I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one. The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky. It smells great, too.\\n__label__2 good price, better than expensive!: Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day. I can\\'t afford to not protect my breakable hear, and i can\\'t afford to buy the products from salons.I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays. What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...) protectors are, watery (opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used)its my go-to when i\\'m low and dont have much money. its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while...for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five. I would recommend this. However, there are better out there.\\n__label__1 Makes my hair feel like straw: I\\'ve only bought this in stores, not on amazon & I don\\'t care for it at all. I prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now.\\n__label__2 I love it.: it\\'s cheap, its good, it works! ive seen alot of youtubers use this product, so i decided to give it a try! it goes great, though i think i love the dove better the dove one smelled better nd left my hair smooth, not with this one though.\\n__label__1 Empty bottle: Im soooo angry.....I am so upset, I received the package wet, it was not well close, so i only got the bottle empty. :@\\n__label__2 Light and no grease!: I was really skeptical about this product. In the past I have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy, sticky, and not manageable. However I was really suprised by this product. I used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair. It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it (but now I get the heat protection).Very impressed. Although I purchased this item at Target for about $2.99 so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else.\\n__label__1 Hated it: Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this. It made my hair feel nasty and caked up. I won\\'t be purchasing again. I guess everyone is different. I have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards. If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle. I got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn\\'t laying around in the \" crappy cosmetics abyss\".Good luck\\n__label__1 Very dissapointed...: I normally am very pleased with sony products, but this one has been very dissappointing. It has (in the middle of the night) re-set itself to the wrong time on numerous occasions. Just this morning I fed the baby at what I thought was 4:30 am. It looked too light outside so I checked another clock and sure enough, it was actually 6:30am. My husband, who normally wakes up at 5:30 am, was late for work this morning. This has happened several times.\\n__label__1 NOT-radio controlled: While the unit indicated strong signal, it could not set the time automatically. The reception here is very good and it is my third radio controlled clock: the first one is from Bulova and the second one is from La Cross. Both of them work perfectly. I spent 2 (!) hours on the phone with Sony technical support, but they could not figure out what was wrong. Very dissapointing!\\n__label__1 Time resets to random times: I\\'ve had Sony Dream machines for years as my bed side clock, and I was excited to buy this one. What a mistake. The time regularly just jumps to a random time in the middle of the night. Because of this, I\\'ve been late to work a few times. I can not stress how disappointed I am, or discourage people strongly enough not to buy this alarm clock.\\n__label__1 Worst Clock Radio Ever: It\\'s no surprise Sony discontinued this item. This is the worst clock radio I\\'ve ever owned. There are a number of problems with this item:- The radio-controlled clock-auto-adjust function does not work at all in my location.- ALL settings including time, alarms and radio presets are lost whenever power is lost.- The display is difficult to read at a distance or at a slight angle.\\n__label__1 Left Me Cold: I was really looking for a book on how to use Bluetooth and what the applications were. This book is written for the geek and techno junky market and not the kind of person who wants to have the latest gadgets in their home and workplace. I was really frustrated to read on and on about profiles (what?) and technical data flow charts. The screen shots were the most useful part of the book.\\n__label__1 Fine in Principle, Faulty in Execution: How and why the Grail translation of the Psalms found its way into the prayer of the Church disconcerts me. The rendering of Psalm 110 (Psalm 109 in the Douay-Rheims Bible), for example, is grievious. Striking at the heart of the Church\\'s prayer (i.e., the Psalms) strikes at the heart of the Church\\'s belief. The insipid \"modernization\" of the Glory Be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head, too: who takes it upon themselves to even do this, then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful, anyway?I eventually gave up on this volume, out of frustration, and began praying the Psalms with the Douay-Rheims Bible and the Latin Vulgate, learning a little Latin as I went on. God willing, I would soon like to get the Latin Breviary.In addition, due to similar dissatisfaction with ICEL\\'s treatment of the liturgical texts, I\\'ve purchased the 1962 Missal and begun to attend the Tridentine Mass--thanks be to God!\\n__label__2 Beyond inspiring: I cannot believe I am the first person to review this movie. An overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering, and yet full of surprising humor. I was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking, but I was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the US.Their perspective on the US culture is very sobering and still hopeful. Everyone should see this movie especially young people. What these men have been through is beyond inspiring. It challenges me to make the most of my opportunities.\\n__label__1 This is the Best They Could Assemble?: I read the first tale FRUITING BODIES by Brian Lumley and thought \"that was pretty good, but I hope it isn\\'t the best tale in the book\". Unfortunately it was... There are a few other good ones like FOET by F. Paul Wilson, but there is also absolute rubbish like TURBO-SATAN by Christopher Fowler. Two other hidden gems were WAKE-UP CALL by David J. Schow and AMONG THE WOLVES by David Case. I advise anyone reading this to skip this book and instead buy any complete works by any of the authors praised above.\\n__label__1 Dont buy from these people!: I purchased 12 cans of this product and it came from TCI I believe was the company. Five of the 12 cans were completely hardened already and I sent two e-mails to them asking what to do about it with no reply!!! Beware buying from that company they have NO customer service what so ever!!!!!!!!!\\n__label__2 More Harmony books...PLEASE!!: Jayne Ann has been doing trilogies - cranking out three books for a set of characters, and outside her Eclipse Bay, the first one is so good, second two suck! REALLY.However, it\\'s with her Harmony books Jayne Ann really returns to her top form. They are fresh, funny and show she still have the magic. So STOP WASTING TIME ON JUNK and write were you show the same spark of romance and delight in the genre.PLEASE. These characters were so warm, real, sexy and loving. What you other books are missing.\\n__label__1 Pretty superficial examination of far right movement: Mr. Coppola seems significantly more concerned with promoting his own \"bravado\" for simply talking with those in the far right movement. He provides no insight into how and why the movement survives.Basically a superficial and self-promoting book of little consequence. Don\\'t waste your time and money.\\n__label__1 Broken Dishes: Ok - thought after my last GREAT DEAL this looked good too. I stoped unpacking when I found a broken mug - without pieces, which means it was packed that way, most likely a return, and I would never have bought it at any price, too huge to pack and return, so I\\'m going to give it to charity.\\n__label__2 Pfaltzgraff Winner.: Beautiful everyday dishes that won\\'t break your bank. One hundred dollars bought service for 16 people.Pfaltzgraff Naturewood 16-Piece Stoneware Dinnerware Set, Service for 4What a great birthday presant!\\n__label__2 Soulful Sweaty Sweet Southern Stew: Minton Sparks has cooked and conjured up a Southern word-stew that does more than just paint pictures in your mind. As you drink this concoction down you experience memories of place and family that, if you are flesh and blood, are real for you. You don\\'t have to be Southern to understand this cd. You just have to have lived among the species human. Because \"Middlin\\' Sisters\" is, for me, about the essence, the rue, the drippings of joyful, loving, unvarnished, god awful humanity. From \"Trella\\'s Trash\" to \"Line Up\" you\\'ll think to yourself \"I know that person...I\\'ve been to that place...that IS my family.\" If you\\'ve ever had a drunk uncle or an aunt you adored or a grandmother with a switch in her hand, you know \"Middlin Sisters\". No cd has ever made me FEEL like this one does. Minton Sparks - Lord God this woman is 100% ALIVE!! And her gift is that she makes me remember that I am, too.\\n__label__2 phil lives: these phil ochs cd\\'s are like life nowadays, just keep listening to keep your soul and mind from drowning in the absurdity of the times. It\\'s music and poetry for the thinker that will face the pain and reality of being trapped in the situation of being fodder unit for the tyrants.\\n__label__2 Smooth Base for Your Makeup: I\\'m using this primer after switching to it from Laura Geller. I find the Mercier to be non-oily and it provides a good base for other face mkeup. I wish it had a sunscreen in it though.\\n__label__1 Laura Mercier cosmetics: After reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics I decided to take the plung. I purchased the primer, moisturizing foundation, and translucent powder. Personally they are not worth the $$$ and I returned them. I actually looked worse and washed out. It may work for some individuals but not me. I am going back to my Mary Kay!\\n__label__2 ON ALBUM NUMBER 3 ANITA BAKER DELIVERED YET ANOTHER HIT!: Not as strong her first two previous releases, but this held it\\'s own, and still proved that she was here to stay! She had a #1 Billboard Hit with the Title Track, another #1 Billboard Hit Single with \"Just Because\", and the Billboard #4 Smash \"Lead Me Into Love\". This project included the Album Favorite: \"Good Love\". Although this project only had 8 Tracks, I\\'m pretty sure it wasn\\'t going to kill album sells by pulling a 4th Single (Ehich could have been \"Good Love\"), but when everything was said and done Anita Baker had another Top Selling Gold Album!!!\\n__label__1 Jane Austin would be outraged: I found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable, however that was not the worst of it. There were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading Pride and Prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous. Conversations and situations so mimicked Austin\\'s books that it bordered on plagiarism Vert disappointing\\n__label__2 Breathtaking Story for East and West: Believe me, as soon as I move with the story of novel, the irresistible force dragged the reader with such strength that reader forgets who has written the novel.The major messages of this novel are to the western readers - wonderfully affectionate mothers and ever lasting friendship across genders. Both tragedies and comedies overlook each other, ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of Vasavi, go back to soil, resounding what great Tagore wrote, \"Lets go back to earth\", which took shape of developmental NGO, PRAGATI, which is a dream in our life, not unreasonably. Once started reading this novel, one remains breathless till the novel ends. The contour of the novel is never and no where flat, rather full of ups and downs, lovely twists and bents. Surely this novel will win hearts of many western readers who lack emotion about mother and friendship\\n__label__1 How...How...How Dare They?!?!?: It sadly possible to butcher an excellent musical so that it could be used only for torturing your enemies. Not one voice was correct. Especialy Valjean. So if you have an ounce of sanity please do not buy this.\\n__label__1 Garbage card--WHAT A WASTE: This card was a waste of $130. It won\\'t do what most on-board sound cards do: record a mix of streaming audio & external audio. If I record an external sound source, then decide to record an internal sound coming from the PC I have to stop everything & change a setting on the (not close to being user friendly) control panel. The control panel in the manual is completly different than wha shows up in Windows 7. I am very disappointed in this and will return it.What a WASTE\\n__label__1 wasn,t what they showed it to be.: what can I say the pictu bushing for the complete front end, when it came just 2 bushings for one spring.\\n__label__1 no go: This works for me only if I take 2 dots and it will only work for a few hours then it wears off. I will keep the jar with me this semester and see if it helps on the go. Update later.\\n__label__2 excellent back yard solution: We\\'ve had this for almost a year. It is completely trouble free. We do set it up on a tile table, because it is small and our cluless dog walked over it (Thankfully he was unhurt). The unit puts out a nice amount of heat and extends the season we can sit outside. it is simple and trouble free to light. The cover screws down to keep rain out and the medium (I think it is vermiculite) in. I haven\\'t taken it camping, but it would be easy to do so. Best money I\\'ve spent in a while. Highly recommended.\\n__label__1 D: WRONG STUFFSUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU\\'RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT! WOOT!\\n__label__1 Volumes: As much as I love Family Guy, I still can\\'t understand this volume business. Thirty to forty dollars for 12-13 half hour episodes is not acceptable. Smallville and Battlestar Galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of 20-22 one hour episodes (for seasons one and three for BSG, anyway, since I still don\\'t understand the 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, and 4.5 crap, but I waited for the price to drop on those as well).And on top of that, the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box. If a premium price is going to be charged, then I expect premium services.So my complaint isn\\'t the show, which I still give five stars to, but the price and packaging. I did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down, but lets be serious. Shouldn\\'t have to do that.\\n__label__1 Fox is greedy: First of all, I love Family Guy from the day it premiered on Fox, but why can\\'t they (Fox and I\\'m sure Seth has a hand in it too) release all 20-21 episodes per season on one volume like they did for Volume 2 (season 3). After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don\\'t know about you but I\\'ll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I\\'ll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer\\'s strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes.\\n__label__1 Will the real Peter please stand up, straight?: So, we finally come to find out that the dolt of an idiot, Peter P. really is GAY!!That explains a whole lot about the guy, doesn\\'t it??\\n__label__2 1 CD has bad quality: I am not sure why one of the 3 CDs have bad color quality - as if it is a pirate version... everything else was great.\\n__label__2 Pretty good: It is a pretty good episode, I have watched it a few times. I never would have expected it out of a relative of Quagmire,\\n__label__2 A Pearl From A Pulp Shell: I became familiar with this character totally by chance. When the paperback collection was released in the 70s, I was baited by the tag line calling him a \"supernatural Sherlock Holmes\". The stories are well written almost to the point of classic literature, introducing characters with a taste for excitement, a never-ending knowledge of the bizarre and an interesting sense of justice (The Corpse-Master from \"the Casebook Of Jules de Grandin\" is an excellent example this.) Who cares if a few of the stories were a little campy, even those tales were fun to read. Since I bought the collection in the seventies, I\\'ve lost two of the volumes to \"Acts Of God\" but the four survivors have remained a treasured part of my library, worthy of rereading several times.\\n__label__2 Very talented!!: I purchased this CD because of the song Black #3 but after receiving it I fell in love with the whole thing. I had never heard of John but glad I have now! Very heartwarming songs!\\n__label__2 SPORTS inflatables.: I thought they were a bargain for what I gave for them. My kids loved them and had a blast sitting in them to play video games.\\n__label__1 Not one of the better KW albums: Computer world, TransEurope, Autobahn, even Tour de France are well worth getting. This one really disappointed me. Didn\\'t have what Kraftwerk is good at - this was to overly polished and boring. In my opinion. Some people may really like it.\\n__label__1 Poor radio reception: Under the cabinet seems to only add more static!!! Sending this back right away, my wife wanted this solely for the Radio and her stations are static whereas my little Clock radio seems to pic up the stations perfectly!\\n__label__2 A must for those wanting to grasp modern molecular biology.: This book is actually a readable text explaining many of the pioneering methods of molecular biology. It does get quite technical, but it does a fairly good job explaining difficult concepts with the help of illustrations. I originally used this book as a text, and keep it now as a reference when I need to recall details about a technique. For those without any science background, it may be a challenge, but if you have the interest, it would be a lot of fun. The only bad thing about the book is that it really needs to be updated, although I should note that most of the techniques described are in current use with only slight modifications.\\n__label__1 Junk: I have been using the PT1180 for a few years now. The cartriges are expensive and they jam. I have thrown away a few of them now worth about $50.00. I like the look of the finished product, but don\\'t be fooled by an inexpensive intial cost. Factor a lot of wasted tape into your purchase.\\n__label__1 Still trying to wash the STINK off: Whew! Unlike the others below, I hadn\\'t seen \"Ghost Watcher One,\" but was unlucky enough to pick this up at the library. I think the only thing that works in this film (looks like it was shot on video) is the sound recording. Directing, acting, cinematography and story are all uniformly bad, along with ridiculous makeup. \"The Dude\" below, is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking. And what\\'s with the towel over the bedroom door??? Attention Aspiring Filmmakers: you should watch this as inspiration that you don\\'t need an Academy Award winning script to get your movie made. It will make you feel like your Francis Ford Coppola, David Lean and Steven Spielberg all rolled into one. Wish I could write more, but I\\'m still trying to get rid of the stench this video left.\\n__label__1 Medicinal and Smells like toothpaste...: I wanted to like this product based on some of the reviews but I just can\\'t. First, it smells like Colgate toothpaste and that\\'s a no go for me with regard to a face balm.Secondly, it\\'s got a stinging quality that I do not experience in products like Nivea for Men or other shaving balms I\\'ve purchased. I want to be comfortable after I shave and apply balm, not wincing in pain.I\\'ll finish using this product because it\\'s tolerable but I won\\'t buy it again.\\n__label__2 Jury is in - He LOVES it!: Bought this as a stocking stuffer for the hubby two years ago - now he cannot live without it! This coming from a Naval Officer - not a GQ reader. He says he loves the way it makes his skin feel after a shave; he gets a cooling effect and he has noticeably fewer to no ingrown whiskers. He also likes that it keeps his skin soft. The scent dissipates very quickly; he does not want to have a lingering aroma or smell like cheap aftershave. I am putting some in my grown boys\\' stockings this year; I\\'ll make junkies out of them too!\\n__label__1 It\\'s not really \"fragrance fee\": I like the texture and the feel after applying the balm but it has a wierd smell and it\\'s definitely not fargrance-free. So folks who are particular in buying a fragrance free balm please be aware of this. I also feel that its bit pricey compared to other non-alcohol based balms (Proraso, Musgo Real etc.,)\\n__label__2 not necessarily a fan but this album is remarkable: I saw They Might Be Giants live and enjoyed the show, and bought this album as a result. I have no artists or styles to compare this to but it is eclectic and a bit strange with lots of variation in style, and if you hear the same songs live they are even more so. The musicianship visible on stage is something I have seen nowhere else.\\n__label__2 A true classic: I just went to a TMBG concert in which they played Flood in its entirety, and was reminded what a great album it really is. Hot Cha is probably the weakest song, and it\\'s not that bad - and it\\'s pretty much the only song I\\'d even call weak. This andFactory Showroomare probably the only two TMBG albums that I would say are winners straight through (although I haven\\'t listened to their kids albums - yet). Others, like Apollo 18 or The Else, are a mix of hits and misses, but these two just keep on delivering. And of course, this album contains Birdhouse In Your Soul, probably the single best song the Johns have recorded.If you\\'re here because you\\'ve bought their music for your kids and are curious what their adult music sounds like, Flood is absolutely the place to start.\\n__label__2 The Best TMBG CD as of 1990!: This compilation of They Might Be Giants songs has all their best and most recognized hits. The neccassary For the TMBG fan! Another Great thing about \"Flood\" is that this songs are so good, that practically any Alternitive Rock Fan could learn to Love They Might Be Giants through this album!\\n__label__1 doesnt stretch at all: Contrary to the dimensions given by some reviewers, i found that you cannot stretch this cushion at all. i tried stretching it over my headset and it immediately broke into pieces.also, the seller refused to give me a refund for the sameAvoid trying to adapt this cushion to non-plantronics headsets\\n__label__2 They fit; they work.: There isn\\'t much more I could say about these except they are a manufacturer\\'s part and they work as designed.\\n__label__2 GREAT!: GREAT Product...GREAT Price...5 STAR ***** EVERYTHING !!! Was an absolute pleasure doing business and I will be back for more purchases I HIGHLY recommend. Thanks a MILLION.\\n__label__2 Plantronics Ear Cushions: They\\'re just what I wanted. No problems replacing the old ones. Comfortable on the ears, and sound is good.\\n__label__1 Grizzly plug cutters: If you\\'re looking for cheap, this is the way to go. They didn\\'t get past the test phase in my shop. I\\'ll keep them though, as a reminder of the non-quality products that Grizzly sells. I cannot believe they stay in business selling tools as such!\\n__label__2 great,but really for the hard core fan.: i have several of the 2-disc super expansion deluxe editions of his albums.the original albums on disc 1 are treasures but usually the second discs are outtakes and non-essential things that even hard core fans will rarely play.if you find a really good price,as i did for this,buy it.otherwise,a good single disc remaster will probably be all that you want.\\n__label__2 good stuff: I like this product. I had to buy like $2 dental floss though to get free shipping, and save like $8 -- and then they came separately packaged and on separate deliveries! Wish they\\'d just raise the price $2.\\n__label__2 A huge hit at our house!: My family (11 year old son included) loves these cereals. They are not quite as \"heavy\" as your typical granola, not too sweet, and the flavors are wonderful. The Amazon price is significantly less that if you purchase at your local supermarket and, although they are still pricier than typical breakfast cereal, I feel better about feeding them to my family.\\n__label__1 Not as good value as I thought: I liked the variety and the taste of granola overall. I didn\\'t like the Vanilla and Hawaiian, but even those were not too bad. My main problem were the bags are very small. They are listed at 13 oz, but seemed smaller than that. My family went through them very quickly. At the current price and amount you get, I don\\'t think I would buy this again.\\n__label__1 Navy Seals in Vietnam.: As if we don\\'t have enough books about Special Forces in Vietnam, here is still another one. Dockery\\'s writings do not have the flow, and this short book takes longer than needed. The reader gets information about some of the missions, equipment, and the Brown Water Navy. The Navy Seals did not contribute as much as the Marines and Army in Vietnam. Still we get another book about Special Forces.\\n__label__1 NO FUN: Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age. I guess for almost $40 you shouldn\\'t expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn\\'t even deserve the one star I gave it.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: There was no description of how much video you can record with this camera. I purchased this camera for the purpose of making videos, and I also knew it took good pictures. I wanted that feature, also, so I figured it said it takes video, so if I had a big enough memory capacity, it\\'ll take bigger videos...wrong. It\\'s a 3 minute limit - and I was never informed of this on Amazon. Now I\\'ve spent $150 for practically nothing. On top of that, when I got this camera, the battery kept dying, even WITH a full charge. So I had them send me another battery, which kept dying on me the same one the last one did. So I am very disappointed with how this turned out.\\n__label__1 Warning! This camera has a manufacturer defect!: This camera has a defect that wont let it recognize some SD cards, but it doesnt show up until after you have taken some shots. I took 50 pictures on vacation, then the camera went dead. It turns out that there was a defect which you can read about on Canon\\'s website that causes ALL these cameras to malfunction until you download and install a patch. Buyer Beware! i lost all 50 irreplaceable vacation pictures, and you will too.\\n__label__2 Beautiful...: I have always used Epson perforated 4\"x6\" photo paper to print photographs, but since I just got the Canon S9000 printer and started using the Canon Photo Paper Pro 4\"x6\" borderless - I\\'ve been amazed. Compared to Epson\\'s paper, the Canon is the closest film developed on paper! The Canon paper is smooth, shiny and the colors are vivid. Without the perforations, the paper looks like it\\'s developed professionally. Every package comes wrapped in a clear plastic sealed bag, and inside are the 20 sheets of photo paper along with a soft tissue paper to protect the first sheet, and a hard cardboard on the back to keep the photos nice and flat.The only problem is that the surface of the Canon Photo Paper Pro is that it\\'s easily to scratch when rubbing against other paper or your fingernail. It\\'s not too noticable unless you look at it in an angle in the light.But overall, it\\'s the best paper for 4\"x6\" photos you want to print yourself! Great quality from Canon, I\\'m not buying Epson paper again.\\n__label__2 Good safe: It works well. Small and compact. Holds my XD 45 Tactical with a tactical light equipped nicely.I do not like that it requires batteries and the buttons are very stiff. Buttons may loosen up with use.\\n__label__2 A Great Sturdy Gun Vault: This gun vault was exactly what I needed. Nice quality construction, Easy to open with key, or finger code. Easy to program new code. etc... I highly recommend this gun vault, BUT advise you to carefully measure your handgun (tip to tip) and compare it to the inside dimensions of the vault. Common sense I know, but give yourself some room to remove the handgun without banging it on the sides, or under the lip of the sides, or even having to finagle it out of the vault completely. I intended to place a .38 Special revolver in it, BUT the tip of grip to tip of barrel was just a tad too long. So now I either buy a new, smaller handgun, or a bigger vault! Also, there is not a 9volt battery included, so you should have one ready so you can program your new code immediately. It\\'s a GREAT gun vault. I just didn\\'t measure twice first.\\n__label__1 Safe Now Opens Itself! Very Dangerous, find something else.: Length:: 1:00 MinsI\\'ve had this for about 3 years and just found today that it will \"open itself\" if I induce a little vibration by pushing it along my floor. Shocking and terrifying to say the least.\\n__label__2 Great Safe: This is a great Safe, it is easy to program and the push buttons are easy to find in the dark with the indented finger positions. It easily fits my revolver and extra rounds.\\n__label__1 code: you have to enter a code by pushbuttons . i dont recomend having to remember that in an emergency would suck ..... i sent this back and got a handgun safe that scans your finger and opens...... backup key opener to...... much faster\\n__label__1 Inaccurate description: Product description indicated this is an \"audio CD\" when, in fact, it is a DVD so could not play it in the car.\\n__label__2 A True American Original: Paul Thorn caught me totally by surprise a few years ago as an opening act when he came out with only his guitar and voice and wrapped the whole room around his finger. I caught him a couple of years later with his full band and it was a religious experience. I have attended thousands of live shows, starting in 1970, and I would put that show in my personal top 20! This DVD, with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band, comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can. The sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time. Paul has found the ultimate blend of rock, blues, gospel, classic R&B; and country. He and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that\\'s exceedingly rare anymore. The DVD and bonus live CD are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find. You need to see this man\\'s band live, but if you can\\'t, buy this DVD and crank it up!-Billy Rollings\\n__label__2 Make the photo: I don\\'t go anywhere with my digital camera without this and its lens. It makes the photo.The one thing that happens is you can\\'t use the optical viewfinder, for the conversion lens blocks it.No big deal, works just great for me!\\n__label__2 The quintessential Cure album!: This is by far my favorite Cure record. It\\'s the only CD that I own that I don\\'t skip songs on...everything flows, the mood is never interrupted, and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener\\'s mind. The Cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will, and the poignancy and wistfullness of Robert Smith\\'s words is touching, moving and exhilarating. Behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music. I recommend this CD to anyone who doesn\\'t already own it; this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist\\'s vision.\\n__label__1 Do not order from Hastings: I\\'d rate this zero stars if i could. I ordered \"The Cure: Disintegration\" on NEW VINYL. I received a USED CD. When I called, I was told I could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me (this is a Christmas gift and I would now receive it after the 25th). Once I went to my email to print the return label, there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and I would just have to return the incorrect item. I am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication. Now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for Christmas, and Hastings is refusing to send the correct item\\n__label__1 Garbage: Disintegration is right...The Cure were best when they did fun pop songs, like in the 80\\'s and early 90\\'s! Pop songs are what gets played on radio, and the radio is the only sure sign of what\\'s good in music.Obviously this album doesn\\'t get played on the radio.I took a chance with this album, thinking it would feature the \"fun\" rock side of Robert Smith. Alas, it\\'s totally boring rock. I understand that The Cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever, but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something. Yes, it\\'s very cinematic; cinematic with Smith\\'s mopey vocals, which sound so much better when he\\'s in a good mood. And why wouldn\\'t the guy be in a good mood? HE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!! Simply put, this album is too long, too brooding, and too ambitious in scope.For people in college only.TAKE CARE!!!\\n__label__2 amazing: I bought this CD after losing the cassette years ago, and the rediscovery of this music has been an emotional experience. Such beautiful music and lyrics, greatly underappreciated by the popular music industry. I can\\'t get enough of this incredible CD.\\n__label__2 Doris Day Fan: I love Doris Day movies! Everything from Pillow Talk, That Touch of Mink, Please Don\\'t Eat the Daisies, Send Me No Flowers, Do Not Disturb, etc, Doris is, by far, one of the best in romantic comedies. Pair her with any leading man and she nails it. Rod Taylor, James Garner, David Nivens, Cary Grant and Rock Hudson. Having these guys as her better halves was tv couple-pairing at its best.\\n__label__1 THIS ONE IS EVEN WORSE THAN GLASS BOTTOM BOAT. DORIS DAY AND ROD TAYLOR.: THIS one is the 1960\\'s DUMB BLONDE, PAMPERED WIFE movie. Doris Day is married to Executive Rod Taylor. HE works all the time--SHE hangs around the mansion with nothing to do except dress up (A spectacular wardrobe is the THIRD STAR). I think this one is PRETTY BAD (except for HER WARDROBE). Stuff happens, but most of it is DRIVEL--not even worth mentioning.I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS. Good is good. Bad is bad. THIS ONE IS BAD.\\n__label__1 This cd had the right idea, but somehow failed: My interest in Michael goes back to the mid 80\\'s, when he first went out on his own. I have most of his cds and really enjoy his voice. The concern I have for this cd as well as his other cds is material content. Michael usually does\\'t choose the songs that I enjoy listening to. He chooses a repertoire that is not necessary the big hits of yester year. One thing i\\'m certain of is that Michaels\\' voice always sounds good on all songs.With the voice of Michael on the so called great songs, I think that he would have one great cd after another. Perhaps he should take my suggestion and try this new approach to song selection. There\\'s really nothing to loose and a lot of gain.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.\\n__label__1 Good stuff, but....: The Bible quizes and outlines are excellent, but I have a problem with this book. This book suggests that people should read from the New Revised Standard Version Bible which is known as the \"Gender Neutral Bible.\" Some liberal churches use this for text during services. It suggests reading from translations that have problems with them. I am a person that is King James only.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t waist your money: While the Fire Dancer is a great product (it works great and we love it), this Fire Pit for the Fire Dancer is complete garbage. Rarely have I felt so ripped off.The cast plaster stones don\\'t look even close to stone, but I guess it\\'s a good thing they aren\\'t as there is nothing to hold them together (aside from gravity) and it might be even more annoying to put them back together after they fall apart from being slightly bumped.I would also think as they are just cheap plaster casts, one might actually be able to make them fit the product they were made to surround... But they don\\'t. There\\'s about a half inch gap all around where you can see through to the cheap legs the thing uses to prop up the Fire Dancer in the middle.Don\\'t throw your money away. Don\\'t buy this.\\n__label__1 JavaScript Complete Concepts and Techniques: I have been working with this book for several weeks now...sorry to say the title is very misleading. \"Complete\"? Maybe in concept only! The Shelly Cashman Series is usually very good, but the proofreaders were WAY overworked with this one. There are several errors in the tutorials that make it VERY frustrating to use if you are just learning JavaScript. I find the code testy enough without sloppy work on the writer/editors/proof-reader/publishers \\'s part. I have spent HOURS to get the tutorials to work, in some cases just having to cut bait. Folks at the publishers, take this one home and try it out. I\\'m tempted to send you back my corrected book with the multiple errors that I have found. Fix the mistakes and try it again. Gentle readers, this one is ONE TO AVOID.\\n__label__1 Book was written for Windows 95: There are many complaints about this book, but what people need to realize is that this book was based on someone coding Java on a Windows 95 machine! Page 1.8 shows the program list, with some Win 95 programs. Now that most people are coding on Windows 7, how can this really be relevant? They need an updated version that fits with computers we use today. Page 5.22 shows ancient computers in a shopping cart. I know the basics haven\\'t changed much, but come on: saving on a floppy disk?!\\n__label__2 Great Fun---Glad It\\'s a Series: I happened upon this series by accident, and a lucky accident it was. I\\'ve been reading the books in order. The series doesn\\'t disappoint and I thought this book was the best so far. There\\'s an immaculate confection (no, it\\'s not Doug Flutie with icing,) skullduggery in the vestry, a maybe miracle, and a developing romance. In addition to the central mystery, each book also contains the main character\\'s wonderfully horrible Raymond Chandleresque novella. The writing is clever and the language is an absolute joy and laugh-out-loud funny. Bar none, the novellas have the very best awful mile-long similes ever written.Although much of the plot involves an Episcopal Church, the story is neither preachy nor sacrilegious. The plot moves along quickly, the characters are likeable, and the stories are great fun. The price of the books is a steal. I\\'ll probably regret saying all this because the publisher will jack up the price. Be that as it may, this is a fun read.\\n__label__1 Can\\'t get through it.: Started reading Jack London lately and really like his work. This is way different from the London that I am used to reading. Very boring. No excitement. Must be another side of Jack London, but I\\'m not interested. Can\\'t get past the the first four chapters. Don\\'t think that I am going to try anymore either.\\n__label__1 Check your camera manual first!: Amazon lists this as the AC adapter for the Canon Powershot A510 but it is not the right one. The voltage is wrong and the plug is to big.My A510 manual lists the ACK800 as the correct AC adapter.So check your camera\\'s manual to make sure this is the right one for you.\\n__label__2 Hahaha, very late review.... great working product.: Indeed, if you have a Canon Powershot you will need this AC device when you transfer pictures from camera to PC. I had mine for almost two years and it works.\\n__label__1 Cable is crap: We plugged this cable into our midi board and the computer only received one out of every 8 to 10 notes. We purchased a Yamaha cable and everything worked fine.But since we opened it, they wont take it back and we are stuck with a useless cable.\\n__label__1 Cracked!: I bought this is Kiwi. It cooks beautifully and cleans up like a dream. Too bad it cracked the third time is used it. From the other reviews, I see my experience is not unique.\\n__label__1 Not a good substitute: An employee at Sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my Dr. Hauschka lip balm stick. It was around the same price range so I bought it. It leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel. However, it isn\\'t completely useless, I use Cauldie\\'s lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular Hauschka lip balm on (now that I can find it at Whole Foods). I won\\'t be repurchasing this item. It\\'s a shame that I couldn\\'t share a wonderful experience like everyone else had. It just goes to show you, product react differently on people.\\n__label__2 Good for vocab and ideas: This book is handy for those intermediate level Spanish speakers who want to increase vocabulary about certain topics. The ideas are not very sophisticated at all, but it presents ideas from different perspectives, and provides some decent vocab. I\\'ve been using it to prep for the Foreign Service Spanish exam, and it has proven helpful. It doesn\\'t cover enough abstract ideas for the 3 level, but it gives enough vocab and grammar to help you get there.\\n__label__2 great music: I bought this for my song writer husband and we both love Michael Martin Murphey.The music was rally enjoyable and he is a good person to support. He does a lot of work to preserve the \\'cowboy way\\' and land use policies in the West.\\n__label__2 fast shipping: excellent condition, great use for my school ager especially on those days he is without home work. I definitely recommend using supplements in addition to the material they use @ school for superior grades\\n__label__2 I HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS BOOK!: I am currently in college taking pipe drafting courses. We use this book as our textbook along with the accompaning workbook. I find it to be very knowlegable and informative as well as well written. It explains step by step how to draw your pipes manually, using auto cad and pro-pipe as well. Illistrations are very good also. My husband has been a welder for 22 years, and now he is also taking this course with me, and agrees with my opinion. This teaches you the basics of piping it is not an indepth book on the subject. but for beginners it is outstanding I would highly recommend it to any one interested in the subject...Kathy Noland\\n__label__2 La La Love it: The Pixies were so irresistably cool and catchy. Doolittle sounds like it was made in some intergalactic recording studio hurdling through the solar system. Who knows what the hell \"Debaser\" is about but holy crap does it rock! The rest of it is just so twisted and good it would be a crime to ignore it. The Pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out.\\n__label__2 Surprisingly there are those, that aren&#65533;t familiar with this: Having always seemingly been compared to \"Nirvana\"...this does the `Pixies\\' little justice, as this...their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything `Nirvana\\' has done. First track \"Debaser\" is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag College Rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who\\'s heard the album always mentions. But it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks, \"I Bleed\" giving a gloomy take on Ironic Pop, but its the irresistibility of \"Here Comes your man\" that invokes images of `The Velvet Underground\\' at their very best...often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band, singer/frontman \"Black Francis\" Quoted as saying...\"Everyone thinks the Pixies were a incredibly popular band, but we were just a Cult band\". Cult band or not...they are one of the most consistently brilliant Rock/Grunge albums bands ever devised.\\n__label__1 i would give this zero stars if i could: I dont like the pixies at all, but this is definatly their crowning acheivement.\\n__label__2 Doolittle: Doolittle being the Pixies 2nd studio album and their 1989 release and the critics loved it and Allmusic and Rolling Stone Magazine gave it max score. I agree with them. This is an incredible album. Two singles were released \"Here comes your man\" and \"Monkeys gone to heaven\". The booklet is quite strange but contains all the lyrics and has a list of whom and what they play on the album. 5/5.\\n__label__2 PIXIES CLASSIC!!!: I really enjoy all the stuff Pixies create, and the songs of the classic DOOLITTLE are all high points in Pixies career! All the songs are great, with the classics GOUGE AWAY, TAME, WAVE OF MUTILATION, DEBASER and MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN!!!! If you like Nirvana, you got to check DOOLITTLE!!!!!!\\n__label__2 American dad season #5: this show has easily become one of my favorite animated series ive watched in along time. well written and the animation is fantastic! the characters are unbelievably hilarious.\\n__label__2 Fast shipping!!: The book is fascinating and the shipping was incredibly fast. Received during the first week of class!!\\n__label__2 So glad I found this!: I\\'ve had this on cassette for years, but about a month ago, my old cassette player ATE my cassette! So I went on a search for the album on CD format--found a new one for a LOT of money. So what a thrill to find it \"fulfilled by Amazon\" at a great price for a used CD. I\\'ve never bought a used CD on line before, but I trust Amazon, so I added it to my most recent order. I am THRILLED to have these songs back again. I don\\'t always like Linda Ronstadt, but the songs on this album, especially w/ Aaron Neville, are awesome. The actual CD case was slightly scratched, but well worth it to save over $20! And the CD itself looks & plays like NEW! Thanks Amazon\\n__label__1 Bad Rheingold Mastering: I had looked forward to this set esp. after the wonderful work Archipel had done with their mastering of the Knappertsbusch 1952 Parsifal and Meistersinger. However, the Rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their 1953 Forza remastering. On headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added - I understand the last three operas are better but I didn\\'t bother . A disappointment.\\n__label__2 If you love Zelda....: If you love Zelda this record is for you. It\\'s music directly from the game so if you want to learn the songs then its perfect. If your a causual fan it is definitly not for you.\\n__label__2 This cd is awsome!!!!: If you loved the music from the Majora\\'s Mask game you\\'ll LOVE this cd! It has every song in it totaling to 112 tracks!!!The only downside is it only runs through the song once. Other than this cd rocks!! If your a zelda fan this is a must buy!!!\\n__label__1 Transform is dissapointing.: Powerman 5000\\'s relase of Transform is definatley one of the most dissapointing relases. All the good stuff about PM5K (the sci-fi themes, space suits, the nice vocals) have all gone away, and turned into just anothers simple alt band. PM5K should have relased anyone for doomsday, because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what PM5K should song like, other than the amazing Tonight The Stars Revolt. I am PM5K fan, and I hope they don\\'t continue going down this road on the next albums.\\n__label__1 Enjoy: I purchased this album after hearing a (1) song from it. The songs in this album are both new (to me) and (old classics). All of the music is compelling and exciting. You can listen, dance or exercise to the music and none of the songs are boring or lacking in an rhythm that makes you want to move.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t work with cable tv: This unit only works with DirectTV, it does not allow you to integrate cable or air tv with the same system. Seems pointless if you want to be able to record multiple programs from both sources.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t buy: When I bought the Tivo set I thought it was great and really enjoyed all the features. But now after just 4 month the modem in the Tivo set is broken, which means it can\\'t dial into the program guide etc. anymore. this means Tivo is pretty much useless. I thought this should be not a big deal until I found out [what it costs to] send in the set to Philips (plus shipping). Just to repair the modem!!! I get a whole new set for that price! Besides the fact that Philips seems to have a problem with their customer service (the average hold time is 45 minutes - I tried it every day during the last 2 weeks). Tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before I will buy a set again. If you buy it, just buy it with a warranty.\\n__label__2 TIVO changed our TV watching life: The TIVO is a terrific product that immediately changed the way my wife and I watch the tube. We got the 30 hour model. Setup was a bit time consuming and required a trip to Radio Shack for some additional cables, but the instructions are detailed and easy to follow.There are four or five shows we like to watch weekly and we are now free to see them at our leisure. Too tired to watch ER or Saturday Night Live? Need to go to a school meeting on Wednesday night but don\\'t want to miss West Wing? Want to watch Seinfeld reruns? No problem. Watch them when you like. And the pause feature is fantastic. Make yourself a sandwich; Take the call from your mother. The show is waiting for you when you return. We now rarely watch live TV because TIVO has recorded other stuff we\\'d rather see than the usual dreck. You\\'ll never need to watch another annoying commercial. We LOVE this thing! Great remote control, too.\\n__label__2 Evolve or Dissolve!: To anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with Linkin Park, Trapt or Godsmack. If you do you won\\'t ever be disappointed. For those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album. Coined with the category \"Math Metal\" by Chad Grey this band is as distant from Nu-Metal as Tool or Deftones as I have heard it described by some. This album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of \"LD50\" with the melody of their follow up album \"The End of All Things to Come\" and then pushed the envelope a little more. Mudvayne is much more polished and for that I commend them. And also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be. So get your @$$ moving and pick up this album. You won\\'t be disappointed!\\n__label__1 World owes you recognition, but you owe yourselves progress.: It\\'s trite to re-interpret the title into the critique, but I can\\'t help regarding `Lost and Found\\' as all too fitting. The best aspects seem like B-sides, while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable.And Mudvayne is supposed to help us forget.It\\'s painful to imagine that they\\'ve hit a creative wall, worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters, but I hear those riffs that were worn out 20 years ago and I just don\\'t know. The experimental sharpness is still floating around in here, but it\\'s measured with points rather than an edge.Gather the mob-funds, guys. But come back and remind us how much more you have to give.\\n__label__1 The smell made it unusable for me: Let me say that I\\'m a John Frieda fan. I use the Frizz-Ease hair serum on my thick, curly hair every day and it works wonders. So I was prepared to like this product.I\\'m not very sensitive to product scents; I will use most anything if it makes my hair look good. This one is an exception, though. It smells terrible -- to my nose it\\'s a combination of watermelon, dead fish, and baby powder -- and the smell does not go away as the product settles and dries. I couldn\\'t even give this a second test try because it smelled so bad. It did make my hair shiny, but there is no way I could possibly use it. Bummer! I see that a couple other reviewers have liked it, though, so it\\'s definitely a subjective matter and not everyone would find the smell so objectionable.\\n__label__1 Tune Out This Book: Sorry, but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet, this book is not for you. This book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits, backed with high-powered marketing. The back cover states, \"Now that the FCC has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations....\" While there is now a low-power FM service, for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required, there have been no \"changes\" governing pirate broadcasting. It\\'s still illegal (and fun). And there is nothing in this book that is going to save you \"thousands of dollars\" over commercial equipment, while giving you the same power and performance. These statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up (and your wallets out) for something this book is not. It\\'s unfortunate that the author, who is probably capable of doing so, did not write a book to match the promised content.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t bother: To be frank, I found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that I have ever read (it was an omnibus). The \\'hero\\' spent most of his time whining, and making everyone else suffer along with him. The writing was well done, but the plot and characters were hopeless. Don\\'t waste your time plowing through it...\\n__label__1 Like wading thru cold maple syrup: I will say that Donaldson\\'s settings and concept were unique at the time of this series\\'s conception. It might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic. But be warned; this novel will leave intellectually spent. Covenant is perhaps the most indecisive, whiny fantasy \"hero\" I\\'ve ever read. I find him thorougly dislikable. He\\'s the kind of guy you don\\'t ask \"how ya doing?\" because he\\'ll take an hour telling exactly what\\'s wrong with his life.\\n__label__1 Didn\\'t Like it: Tried this book on a recommendation from my brother. Found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language, like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words (and I like to think I have a pretty good vocabulary). Kind of like he swallowed a thesaurus and borrowed other peoples stories besides. Read the whole thing, but have no desire to read any more of the series. Main character too angry and couldn\\'t seem to get over it. Wore me out.\\n__label__1 Beware...a Hero that wines and is unsepathetic: I read this book some years ago and just thinking about it to write this review pains me. It\\'s like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull.The \"Hero\" is annoying, winey and while reading this book, I longed for his death or disappearance. The book is a slow, hard read. If your thing is reading about people you\\'d never want to run into/ know (and that\\'s our \"Hero\"), then this book is for you!How this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me. The story has no appeal to me. I can\\'t identify with the main character and it\\'s a horrible read. Honestly, I wish I had never read it. You have been warned!\\n__label__2 A Beautiful Epic of Tolkien Proportions: Donaldson\\'s Thomas Covenant books are masterworks of creative joy, frustration, and eventually triumph. Both the frustration and triumph stem from the intricacies of a complex anti-hero whom the reader will alternately want to curse and salute. The first book, Lord Foul\\'s Bane, is not without flaws, and it does begin slowly as others have noted, but the committed reader will be rewarded with an epic of Tolkien proportions and a world which is painful to depart once the last page is done. I have returned to this series many times over the years, and it holds a place of honor in my collection.\\n__label__2 First-class science fiction fantasy: Stephen Donaldson\\'s Thomas Covenant isthe only books I\\'ve read THREE times.A fantastic story, with great depth.If you like Tolkein, this is a must-read\\n__label__2 Great book: Received this book super fast - which was great since I needed to read it for my class.The book was in perfect condition!\\n__label__2 A Great Addition: My experience with this book was certainly different from that of the reader above. I loved the book. I have referred to it many times and have tried many of the ideas. I recommend it completely, and I am plan on buying 103 as soon as I can.\\n__label__1 Wrong Book: I was sent the wrong book. Then he claimed he sent the right one that I never recieved. He refunded my money but I am frustrated!\\n__label__2 An excellent album: This is a great album. There is a breadth of tone and subject matter, though all the songs come from Billy Bragg\\'s perspective, and are quite political in nature. To specifically address one criticism on this site, Billy did not write a new tune for \\'The Red Flag\\', he states that he is returning the lyrics to their ORIGINAL tune, which is a lively Irish reel; the effect is to give the song the energy and enthusiam it requires.\\n__label__1 Hymns to holocaust: Bragg has always been abysmal as a singer/songwriter, but recording the anthem of a political movement that killed millions around the globe is in bad taste--even for pop music. Crank it up, comrades, and blast back to the era of the gulags, that era you love so well.\\n__label__2 Works with Mac G5: Works with a Mac G5. Drivers installed without problems. The USB jack needs to be plugged in directly to the Mac though, or a powered usb hub. Otherwise, the Mac fails to see it. Running OSX 10.3 dual 2.5Ghz.I wish it came with a rack mount adapter instead of purchasing separately.\\n__label__1 Everything but ...: The Sony CD clock radio almost has everything I was looking for. A CD player. Easy use of both alarms. The ability to set both alarms to the radio (this sounds simple, but many CD clock radios (Timex, Panasonic) allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms). Good sound. Very good looks. But unlike most clock radios, it does not have a battery backup. As my area periodically gets short blackouts, this is needed. Especially since getting to work depends upon it. If you do not need the backup, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.\\n__label__2 My first computer generated deck and... I love it!: At first I was pretty sceptical when I saw some pics of it on aeclectic.net but last year, I discovered the German version of the deck at my local book shop and I fell immediately in love with it. As I am a tarot reader and collector, I have some decks and always refused incorporating a computer generated deck in my collection but I had to have this deck. I use it for my personal readings and I am always amazed how it \"clicks\" with me. I got some very interesting insights with this deck.I also like the book as it tells about local British myths and lore but I would not recommend it for absolutely tarot newbies. You have to have quite a bit of background knowledge.\\n__label__1 You\\'re kidding right?: This music is very weak.If you know your Jazz then you will look to Carla Cook--the only Max Jazz artist worth your time--believe me.\\n__label__1 Not as good as I hoped: Although the product was definitely better quality than the valve I replaced, it definitely did NOT provide 100% flow shotuff. It wasn\\'t even close. The remaining flow is significantly more than dripping and closer to a weak stream. It does REDUCE the flow, but certainly does not shut it off.\\n__label__2 Works just fine: Easy to use and adjusts water supply as advertised. As some complained, it doesn\\'t shut off completely, but I really wouldn\\'t want it to.\\n__label__1 How can people be so gullible.: In 1996 an 11-year old girl did a science project in which experienced \\'practitioners\\' of HT were asked to detect her \\'energy field\\' and given a 50-50 chance of guessing. The results: 44% of the time, the HT adepts were able to guess correctly. A coin flip would generate approximately 50%. This is nothing but a scam and all scientific tests have proven this fact.I would not waste 10 cents on drivel like this. If I could have given it zero stars, I would.\\n__label__2 Very good: I really like this book, and the three--book series, in general. Lots of good puzzles, big-enough type, etc. Small, easy to carry around, take on trips, etc. Receommend.\\n__label__1 Worthless Purchase: I only give this a 1 because I can\\'t choose a zero.Whomever wrote the puzzles for this book obviously doesn\\'t know the rules of sudoku:No number can appear twice within a column, row, or 9-box sub-section (nor located in the same box within the 9-box sub-section). I\\'m a sudoku fanatic, so I\\'m very versed in the rules. When I sat down and started working the puzzles, I found myself running up against instances on every puzzle where the same number would have to appear in the upper left hand box of each sub-section twice within the same puzzle (which is a BIG no-no). When this happened 10 times in a row, I went back to the answer page and discovered all of the puzzles had this defect.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!\\n__label__1 Sadly, Enough\\'s Enough: This is the ultimate Greil Marcus parody, by the master himself. Ideas like a solemn correlation between an Elvis Presley postage stamp and Clinton\\'s election are announced without even a smirk. Coming next: KNOCKED OUT LOADED: FINDING EVIDENCE OF ELVIS AND DYLAN IN EVERYTHING AFTER FALLING DOWN AND HITTING MY HEAD.\\n__label__2 Delivery Problem - Turned Out Great: I added this item into an order at the last minute and forgot about it. When I remembered it a few weeks later, I sent a note to Amazon about the missing item. I was even concerned that I might have thrown it out with the packaging. I have been organizing my supplies so there was only one place this would have been found in my garage.Amazon sent me the item. Now that I have it, it is large enough that I know I did not misplace it or throw it out by mistake.I want to compliment Amazon on their customer service. It gives me confidence to continue to order from them.\\n__label__1 The non-slip material sticks to soft leather: I bought this to protect the soft leather in the Acura TL I bought my wife.The Material they use on the seat facing side came off on the leather.Trying to clean it caused damaged to the leather.Could be due to high temperatures in California.I would think the problem is less of an issue with thicker leather seats like the ones BMW uses but back seat of my Acura TL is now in need of serious attention due to use of this product.\\n__label__1 Deeply Disappointing (sooo glad I only rented it): I was so disappointed with this film: the acting was second rate at best, the greatest offender being the scene with woman at the well (John 4). The ongoing interaction with the Jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch. I remember being so excited about this film, I thought about buying it even before watching it. So glad I only rented it. Believe me, I had heard so many positive things about the film, it made finally watching it even more disappointing. Mel Gibson\\'s \"The Passion of the Christ\" and the recent \"The Nativity Story\" are so superior in production value, with the finest movie on the life of Jesus Christ remaining Franco Zeffirelli\\'s \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" I\\'d certainly recommend these over \"The Gospel of John.\"\\n__label__2 Great video!: The best video concerning any gospel that I have ever seen. Stays strictly with what the gospel says and no personal interpretations.\\n__label__2 Wow: Love the dvd. Henry C is perfect as Jesus and the biblical account of John is spot on the bible. No \"Hollywood\" embellishments in this area. the video leaves you feeling like you\\'ve witnessed Christ first hand and its very peaceful and satisfying. Buy this!\\n__label__1 What they don\\'t tell you: Unfortunately this product was not labeled for use in the US only. I cannot view the DVD in Australia. So \\'buyer beware\\'. What a rip off. I had to give it one star because the system would allow none.\\n__label__2 What better a witness then the WORD itself: I like the Movie because it is not common to see far straying from the WORD, yet it is drawn from the Alexandrian texts which are gnostic, droping many words, and even entire verses (compare NIV 1John 5:7 to NKJV or KJV). Another thing Isaih said the real LORD was not comely (handsom), nor did he have any form (was not well built). Also Mary Magdeline near the end, gets a lot of camara time for some reason, and keeps acting fluttery. All in all I would watch it several times without feeling like I was wasting time, because any of HIS words are enriching.Praise the LORD Jesus, HE has\"magnified HIS WORD above HIS NAME\" Psalm 138:2b,\"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" Romans 10:17,JESUS is alive, HE is risen, HE healed my broken heart, and gave me a new life in HIM.\\n__label__2 The BEST: This is the best Jesus video I have ever seen in my life! It comes in two DVD\\'s, the full length and a shorter one. The man playing Jesus was an actor on LOST. He does a truly inspired portrayal of Christ and you have no problem relating to Him.\\n__label__2 SUPERB FILM: THIS IS THE ONLY BIBLICAL BASED MOVIE THAT IS ACTUALLY ACCURATE WORD-FOR-WORD TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURE. HENRY IAN CUSICK IS PHENOMENAL AS THE MESSIAH; HE IS THE BEST ACTOR CAST AS JESUS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE DIRECTING IS AMAZING AND CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER AS NARRATOR IS PERFECT. I PERSONALLY WATCH THIS MOVIE ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS TRULY THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL BROUGHT TO LIFE.\\n__label__2 Wonderful: I watch this often on quiet Saturday afternoons. It is one of my favorite depictions of the Bible story. I recommend it.\\n__label__1 How large (or small) is it.: I looked around the net and NOBODY gives the weight of this item. I really love cheddar popcorn but will NOT buy an unknown quantity!\\n__label__2 I Can\\'t Believe It Came From Memphis But Then Again I Can: This is a very pleasant collection of songs from a young Memphian I can only call \"ultra-modern\". I live in Memphis. I know Memphis is mostly about Elvis, Sam and Dave, Al Green, Sam the Sham, Carla and Rufus Thomas, Booker T and the MGs, Charlie Rich, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Three Six Mafia, all sorts of rockabilly and soul and gutbucket and rap. But this is really great, too, in a completely different way, more like Big Star and Alex Chilton when he\\'s not really angry and bitter. This is ethereal and damn near giddy music... it\\'s intelligent, rooted in 60\\'s white pop with a carefully crafted psychedelic edge. It floats along, pulls you in and...well, it makes you feel happy. It\\'s ultra-modern -- nobody else sounds like this -- and it\\'s very smart. I can\\'t wait for the follow-up. I\\'m the Big Oh and I gotta go.\\n__label__2 A virtuoso\\'s best work.: The guy was a friggin\\' magician on the guitar. This disc covers so many styles but nonetheless remains tightly knit and cohesive. Country licks, blues, twang, rockabilly, jazz and the Simpsons theme. A superb recording. Serious, fun, deep, shallow. C\\'mon and dig it.\\n__label__2 Hillerman is getting better again.: I used to enjoy Hillerman, but the last few books before First Eagle and Fallen Man left me feeling that he had run out of material. Well, even if he\\'s stealing stuff from John McPhee, I really enjoyed Fallen Man, and I think he\\'s getting even better with First Eagle. I enjoy a good knotty plotline and both of these books deliver. One more note, quite frankly, I never really could stand Janet Pete. Chee needs to stop moping and go after Bernie.\\n__label__1 I eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed.: This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect in Tony Hillerman\\'s Chee and Leaphorn series. The plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic. Chee and Leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics. In this book, all the characters were ho-hum.\\n__label__1 worst acting ever.: i\\'m only 15 minutes into this film and i\\'m finding it hard to keep watching.this is quite possibly the worst acting/directing i\\'ve ever seen in a movie.\\n__label__2 WOW: This album is absolutely amazing! You can listen to the first ten seconds of \"Donna Lee\", right from the opening hit of the drums, through to the beauty of \"Forgotten Love\" and realize this is some pretty hot stuff!Best tracks are \"Continuum\", \"Portrait Of Tracy\", \"Okonkole Y Trompa\" and \"Forgotten Love\". \"Kuru/Speak Like A Child\" ain\\'t bad either.The bonus tracks are alright, but the general album is more interesting.In my opinion, one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished, if not the accomplished player of all time!\\n__label__2 I dig this.: I knew what I was getting when I picked this up, pretty much your standard random-members-band with random vocalists and Paul Di\\'Anno the man himself from the first two Maiden albums. This is good, not absolutely earth-shattering, but that\\'s not the point of these things, as they are tributes by artists who love the band. I gotta say that so far, the Steve Grimmett tracks have to be my favorites, he even comes close to Bruce Dickinson\\'s greatness at times. Di\\'Anno\\'s, while great, seem to be lacking something in the delivery, but that just might be the fact that he\\'s older than he was when he originally recorded them. Then there\\'s Bernie Shaw singing \"Fear of the Dark\" which was great to me because I\\'m a huge Uriah Heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song. All in all, a pretty standard tribute, definitely recommended to all Maiden fans!!!\\n__label__1 buyers beware: Even though these filters are identified as \"SKUTTLE filter part #448-1\", they are not manufactured by Skuttle. Genuine Skuttle filters have 22 pleats; these generic filters only have 17.\\n__label__2 Good for heel spurs: This is the second pair I\\'ve bought. I have heel spurs on both feet and these shoes are soft enough on the back to not put a strain on the spurs. I use them for work and they hold up to the 8-12 hours I\\'m on my feet, I placed my orthotics on top of the insole so thay might be why.The Navy color looks drab grey after washing so I don\\'t recommend that color and I haven\\'t washed the glossy black I have yet. I may not wash them because they can be wiped clean.\\n__label__1 Wish I had kept the box to return them in...: These shoes run large, and are not as comfortable as described. I wouldn\\'t dare wear these for work. They are large/loose in height and length, but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box. I\\'ve bought much better, much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost.I like the color and texture of the material, but don\\'t know how they will look & feel after washing. They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won\\'t buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren\\'t, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money.\\n__label__2 A great show!: I love Law and Order and will purchase all 20 seasons at some point. The rip from the headlines stories are so true. I love the show and hope you do too.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: Sorry to say that I\\'m disappointed with these headphones. I have purchased headphones from V-Moda three times before and they\\'ve been 100% awesome. But these latest headphones, the cord is cheap and gets tangled very easily. Very irritating. I do not recommend.\\n__label__1 Great Sound BUT Poor Durability: Rich highs and deep lows sound great BUT NOT IF THE CABLES FALL OUT Of THE BUDS AFTER 3 WEEKS of routine use!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh\\n__label__1 Epidemic lack of quality please read the reviews before buying!!: These headphones look great and sound quality is great. But mine lost sound in the left ear after 2 weeks! That is completely unacceptable. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Apparently this happens with great frequency. Save $50 and much aggravation and check out the Sony Fontopia\\'s. Those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing. I spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong. You don\\'t get what you pay for. Avoid V-Moda like the plague!\\n__label__2 For their price, these are a great deal!: The V-MODA Vibes are a nice little set of headphones. I use them with my Creative ZEN and they sound great! They don\\'t sound quite as good as the higher end (Ultimate Ears or Shure), but good for the money. They are a tiny bit thin on the Bass, but better than most in their price range. If you need more bass, check out the V-MODA Bass Respone phones.They do need a \"burn-in\" period though to reach their capability.\\n__label__1 Scratchy Scratchy Scratch Scratch: Okay so I had pretty high expectations for this product, because of the many reviews it got and how awesome these looked. It was very deceiving, when I got home and popped these out, plugged them in I was sooo disappointed with the highs on in the headphones. It was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing...The lows were good BUT they do not make up for the highs. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES UNLESS YOU ONLY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH JUST LOWS.\\n__label__1 Amazing for about 3 months: When I first received them they sounded amazing, loved every bit of them from their looks to the sound. I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud\\'s wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That\\'s when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn\\'t buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i\\'m gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them.\\n__label__1 They didn\\'t even last me TWO months!: I bought these on June 6, 2009 and they gave out on me two nights ago (August 19, 2009)! One of the ears just up and stopped working! I have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back. What\\'s the point of this high grade wire protector if they\\'re just going to give out anyway!? And at $50+ I expected much more from this...FAR more. AT LEAST a year...if they had lasted me at least a year then I\\'d at least be satisfied with my purchase, but sadly that was not the case. Cheap non-name brand ear buds from CVS lasted me longer than these things! Avoid these, people. Lest you want to suffer the same frustration I experienced. I\\'m going to try and see if I can\\'t get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer. This shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this!\\n__label__1 Good sound, Bad quality: I bought the red version of these earbuds in January 2008 after tons of research. A lot of the negative reviews I read were about the earbuds shorting out. In my case, after about 2 months, I noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a MUCH reduced volume. At first I thought it was just the stereo mixing of music, but then I realized that, indeed, the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet, and now it annoys me to listen to. A couple of months in and I\\'m SOL - especially since I bought them for $65 on Amazon without a warranty. Splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired.PROS: Sounds good, look great, easy to get in and out of ears (compared to Shure).CONS: They are already shorted. :(\\n__label__2 Very nice: I was searching for some ear buds to replace the standard iPod issue. I got a pair of Shure e2c\\'s for Xmas and have never been able to get them to fit my ears no matter what fitting I used. After much experimentation I was able to get some of the foam fittings to work but the sound was still lacking. No bass at all. After doing some reading I decided to take a chance on the V-MODA Vibes. At first I was a little concerned they might be to bassie. Well, that is not the case. The bass is definitley there but it\\'s not overwhelming by any means. So far I like the V-MODAs a lot. I was able to wear them right out of the box - I haven\\'t even tried any of the other fittings. Plus they\\'re not as clunky as the Shures. The smaller size enables me to fit almost the entire bud in my ear. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Anyone interested in a slightly used pair of e2c\\'s?\\n__label__1 Great sound, poor durability: First of all these earbuds sound great. However, after only six months the wire near the earbuds started to tear away. I sent them back for a new pair almost a month ago, and they still have not shipped the new pair. Great sound but poor durability and terrible customer service.\\n__label__1 Extra Noise: One of the worst purchases I have made. The cords to the earbuds are fabric covered and rub against clothing, creating load rubbing background noise that is high decibel and louder than the music being delivered. I have to binder clip them to my collar to get them to be acceptible. Hate them.\\n__label__2 Great sound...but be sure to save receipt: Title says it all. Left channel/bud started to fade after 3 months of use. Never used earphones with ipod in pocket, so bending of cord was unlikely cause of fault.That said, Vmoda stood behind their product, and provided a quick exchange via mail with proof of purchase.Big picture: Tremendous value and sound. Earbuds are great for passive noise reduction of piped guido music at health club and aircraft noise.\\n__label__2 Better than average: While they look excellent,being metal and shiny,it all comes to soundThey are a type of sound that is very smooth laid back yet detailed.They also have excellent low end bass, not boomy or bassy but deep amd large.There is no listener fatigue from extendid listening of the music,The only fault I could place is a slight lack of brightness I am used to.so key words here are:smooth, detailed, laid back, good bass\\n__label__1 ftoo ragile: The voice from right-hand earbud becomes much lower than the other 1 month after I got it.\\n__label__1 V-MODA Vibe Earbuds: I have used earbuds and headphones extensively for years. I found these to be well made, sized well and comfortable. The sound quality is good but so bass bias it sounded very unnatural listening to my IPOD. I returned them to Amazon and received a prompt refund.\\n__label__2 good buds: good base. i dont feel they are base heavy.the only problems i have:i lost the carrying case with the replacement tips along with it.you can hear the cable moving around when you are wearing them.i want to try the foam tips they sell but they are a bit expensive.they bothered me at first because i wasnt used to having the buds in the canal. u get used to it.i would try a different brand for my next pair.\\n__label__2 Good sound, but not as noise insulating as I hoped: I bought these primarily to use on my commute. I had read they were great at insulating outside noise. I ride a very noisy public transit train in the SF Bay Area and these earbuds really don\\'t block out enough sound. The train wheels just scream on the tracks in some sectinos. These are comfortable and the sound quality of the music is good but if you are looking for something to insulate outside noise, these won\\'t really do it.\\n__label__1 Great looks, sub-par performance: I purchased these headphones twice. The first time was in summer 2008. The headphones were awesome. However, they crapped out after about two months. I returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones.I was craving some nice headphones, and I saw the price on these is substantially down from 2008, so I bought them again (spring 2010). Big difference! The external looks are the same, but build quality is down and the sound quality and in-ear comfort is way down. These are headed back to Amazon for a refund.\\n__label__2 Great Purchase: We recently purchased a touch free trach can thru Amazon. the product is great. It is easy to use and you don\\'t touch the trash can. A wonderful product. the price was outstanding, we had priced similar products upwards of $100, we were able to geet the trach can thru Amazon for less than $50.\\n__label__1 Works great, BUT.....: The touchless operation of this trash can works great. Easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place. BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk.\\n__label__1 useless.: I HATE spending money on BAD products, and this was a bad product! My husband and I used it for a couple months and it already broke. We sent it to the factory for repair, but the same problem happened AGAIN after a few months! Now we don\\'t even use it.\\n__label__1 A mind of its own after five months of use: It was alright at first. Now the lid will open at its own will or not at all even two set of new batteries were changed.\\n__label__2 Best trash can ever: This trash can was purchased to replace a round stainless steel trash can. Not only did it meet our expectations but they were exceeded. The hands-free mechanism works extremely well and the can holds more than we ever imagined. The fact that odors stay inside is an added bonus. Worth every penny!\\n__label__2 So far so good!: This trash can is classy looking, matches well into a stainless/black kitchen, and so far (one month in) has worked great. The size is just right for a kitchen. The sensor takes about 2 seconds to register before opening the lid, while I\\'d prefer a little more immediate response, but oh well. Overall, a very cool addition to my kitchen. If it goes bad, I\\'ll come back and update the review.\\n__label__1 electrical problem: The itouchless trashcan you sent me had some electrical problem. Both powerr sources (batteries and AC adapter) did not work. Power did not come to the trashcan.I mail to the Customer care, but i was told that a warranty does not apply to Japan. At present, I am using the trash can without power.\\n__label__1 This garbage can is GARBAGE: Length:: 1:07 MinsLook - this thing doesn\\'t work anymore. This claim, \"if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time.\" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product.\\n__label__1 The lid stopped working within 6 months.: After comparing step cans and prices at Wal-Mart, Kohls, Amazon and eBay, I found this can for $35 at Costco and went for it. We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn\\'t respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won\\'t open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn\\'t I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I\\'m going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end.\\n__label__2 Saves clean up and time!: I have found this trash can to be a real time saver. First, it has a large opening which prevents spills and other messes. Secondly, because it opens automatically, I spill less and do not dirty the can by touching it constantly. I have had one for two months and am pleased with the performance. Use regular kitchen bags. Getting the kitchen bags in isn\\'t the simplest task, but it does hold the bag in well. Cleans easily. I would recommend.\\n__label__1 What\\'s up with this sensor?: It\\'s interesting that we have recently started experiencing the same problems that others are commenting on. Our sensor has stopped working all together. We have done everything that others say works (replacing batteries, unplugging the cord - which we had to buy separately - and cleaning where the sensor is located), yet this trash can will not work.If you are looking at purchasing this item, please PLEASE read all the comments here first. This device has a very short lifespan - typically a month.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t waste your money: Bought this last week. I\\'m really not sure how this product gets 4 stars from others - it\\'s a piece of junk. Right out of the box, the lid does not close all of the way. I wind up having to press the \\'close\\' button several times. I\\'ve tried the \"leave the batteries out\" trick to no avail. Don\\'t waste your money, and don\\'t believe the other positive reviews. This product is, well, trash.\\n__label__2 touchless stainless trash can: I have had this trash can for 3 years. Absolutely amazing! It finally died after 3 years of everyday use. highly recommend! Loved it! No problems whatsoever.\\n__label__2 Stainless Steel Garbage: I purchased this garbage, one, because I wanted the largest sized stainless steel garbage I could find and, two, I wanted one that looked good. With this product I received the best of both worlds. I enjoy everything about this product, it holds a lot, it looks great, and its motioned sensor opening lid is awesome. This product is by far worth every cent I spent on it. I highly recommend it to anyone. Its overall an excellent product. No complaints here\\n__label__1 Worked ok for a while and then.....: It stopped working....it never opens or closes properly...contact customer support 2 days after warranty ended and they refused to replace.\\n__label__2 Tech Home: I\\'m an electrical engineer and just bought a new home so I\\'m trying to tech it out. This is a great trash can that\\'s perfect in size and function. Everything is working great so far and whenever my friends come over to my place they love to play with it.\\n__label__2 Worth for the money: My wife saw the review and arranged to get this for our lovely new home. When I unpacked the trash can, i felt it was so thin and weightless, slowly I realised that we do not need really a heavy one for this. It is so far working well and feel the importance of touchless. We had house warming few days ago, and everyone who came to the house warming asked where did you buy this. We have two kids, we thought they may play with it, but not at all. The negative aspect of the touchless is to sensitive, even if you walk near by your dress make them to open many time and secondly I feel the time limit of lid opening bit shorter. But these two negative aspect are very minor problem. I would strongly reccommend this trash can to anybody.\\n__label__2 Everybody Should Own One of These!: This is the greatest thing ever! The process to change out bags is slightly more involved than with our old garbage can, but this removes so many other minor inconveniences regarding trashing things...it\\'s hardly a worry.Bag never falls into the can, perfect size for the kitchen, and even looks great! Can\\'t imagine finding a better item at a better price...\\n__label__2 Best Product on Market: I bought this as a gift and was told it was the BEST gift they had ever recieved and uses it daily and recommended it to others!! I bought myself one and was so pleased as to how long the batteries lasted and how well it works, a real attention getter for company! Everyone loves it!\\n__label__1 Canadians - do not order!: I thought this would be a novel product to have in my kitchen. I was thrilled when I ordered it. Trash can arrived by UPS and they charged me a $36.82 brokerage fee to bring it into Canada. When I got it home, it did not work. I sent it back UPS and it cost me $73.22 in shipping. Todays Concept gave me a real hassel with the return. I never got my monies back for brokerage fees and the cost to ship it back. I am out over $100.00 on this transaction. Canadians - live and learn.\\n__label__1 OK until something happens - Customer Service Blows: This trashcan worked great for the first 45 day. Then it kept staying open. Got tech support that didn\\'t fix the issue was told to mail it in. After mailing it in on Dec 8th they said that it was take about 2-3 weeks after arrival before mailing it back to me. Well it is now Feb 15, I have called 5 times and spoked w/ angela who keeps saying it is being mailed on this date or that. Oh it\\'s sitting in receiving and will be sent today. Oh were looking into it. And so on. Will i get it back or won\\'t I. Oh and no one will claim to be the supervisor. Go ahead call them yourselves 800-660-7978 you\\'ll see. Isn\\'t it pretty bad when they know 1 of x number of customers by name???\\n__label__1 Sensitive sensor solution: Not sure if anyone else has posted this solution, all you have to do is cover part of the sensor with black electric tape, the more you cover the closer your hand needs to be for the lid to open. Overall a great trash can, only negative besides the overly sensitive sensor is the stainless steel is a bit too thin.\\n__label__2 Good quality product with great look: This is a great looking trash can that works very well. I have had the trash can for a long time (about a year). It still has the same batteries and doesn\\'t show any size of failing. This trash can is not a bullet proof tank, but it is strong enough to hold all the beer bottle you can fit in it. Like any sheet metal product it will bend if you mistreat it.\\n__label__2 Almost the perfect trash can: Of course, everyone thinks you are crazy for purchasing a hands free trash can but my husband and I really liked the idea. Much more sanitary. The trash can arrived in good condition. Easy to operate (once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position). Looks clean and neat. Space saving. The reason we didn\\'t give it a 5 star rating is: (1) I couldn\\'t figure out how to give it 4.5 stars; (2) the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it (not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might); and (3) it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in. Not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting. I would order again and have recommended to friends (even those who laughed). My husband and I both love it!\\n__label__2 Kitchen automated trash can: Awesome - just could be upgraded by one feature:if you through stuff (eg empty coke can) towards the lid, it should open on time :-)Otherwise it\\'s awesome and I recommended to allof my friends (they purchased alreslady it.)\\n__label__1 Decent, but lacking basic supplies: Works fine, but not designed for all 13 gallon trash bags. Furthermore, I was more than a little surprised when the package came without an AC adapter. Those things cost 20 cents to make, and for a $63 dollar trash can, one should have come standard.\\n__label__1 Lasted about 4 months: Well, it was great for the first 3 or 4 months. Then the door started opening slower and stopped at about half way. Now-a-days, the door only opens 1/3 of the way. When this first started, my first thought was to change the batteries. When that didn\\'t work, I thought it was due to the batteries being old. So I went and bought new D size batteries. They weren\\'t the cheap dollar store batteries. I bought Energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power. Sadly, this has not worked either.So 5 months ago, this trash can was a 5 star. Now it is a 2 star. Unfortunately I expect products to last at least a year before I replace them. This was a waste of money for the trash can (55 dollars) and batteries (12 dollars).The next one I\\'m going to buy will be a step trash can.\\n__label__1 not2pleased: I previously owned an automatic trash can and loved it. Unfortunately it was broken in a move. I haved looked everywhere for a new one and decided to try Amazon.com I did find them, and tried to get the same kind but got as close as possible. I was at first very pleased with the product, but within a few days, the rim kept falling inside the can, the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure. Ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again. I feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath. Thats the way my previous trash can was made.\\n__label__1 The battery cover didn\\'t fit: I could no way close the battery cover. So I duck-taped it to hold the baerries. But the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can. This apparently happened when I emptied the can for the first time. (I ordered this on 1/14/2010.) Sometime after that I realized it stopped working, and found that the cover was permanently lost (to the town dump). I duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot, but after a few hours (maybe a few minutes?) the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of 4 D-batteries, and became loose. So the trash can is totally useless. Had I bought this from Costco, I would take it to the store and they would refund me. But unfortunately I bought it through amazon.com (I had also threw away the box.) I\\'ll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump. What a trash product it is. If amazon.com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well.\\n__label__1 Lid Does not Fit can...: Been using this can for well over a few months now and am now getting around to writing the review. When I first opened this trash can, the lid did not fit the can without an extreme amount of force. Every single time I change the trash bag, I have to literally fight to get the lid back on. Also, this trash can eats batteries like a fat kid eats cake...fast and often.Do not get this trash can!\\n__label__2 Better than expected.: I purchased this really hoping it wasn\\'t just a gimmick and it wasn\\'t. It works beautifully, keeps the dog out, and was worth every penny.\\n__label__2 Finally, a trash can that can do tricks: I really like this trash can. It automatically opens when you want it to, then shuts a few seconds later. I\\'ve only had a problem if I accidentally turn off the power switch in back. I\\'ve replaced the batteries only to discover the switch was turned off. My favorite thing about this trash can, however, is when guests come over! Stand in front of the trash can and pretend it\\'s your pet. Say \"Who wants a treat???\" and after a few seconds get close enough so your hand trips the infrared and then toss the garbage in. Good boy!\\n__label__1 over priced touchless trash can: I ordered this product & paid $100 plus for the item. I found the same identical item for $50.00 at Sams club. The plastic gear that controls the lid is way under engineered. It came apart in less than a year. This destroyed the touchless qualityTouch-Free Stainless Steel 13-Gallon Trash Can\\n__label__1 Nice concept, but poor build quality: I received the trash can with several dents on its side, probably due to shipping. After examining the material it was made of, I concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy. The dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can. I can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional, but the poor build quality of the can itself is why I\\'m returning it.\\n__label__1 Too expensive to only work for a year: I\\'m so sick of these fancy, expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism - in this case the hinge that opens the lid - relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks. This is a beautiful trash can that I liked while it worked, but the little plastic hinge broke and now it\\'s garbage. I\\'ve had the same problem with pedal cans - the whole can is stainless steel EXCEPT for the part that should be, and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk. Grrrr.\\n__label__2 Love the product: I purchased this product two years ago and love it. However, there is one issue with it. As other reviewers stated the mechanism that lets the lid open and close broke off after one year. However, my husband was able to repair it by using super glue. This method worked two more times. Now, that trash can is two years old we can no longer repair it. We are now purchasing our second iTouchless trash can. I hope that they will think about selling the replacement for that mechanism so that when it breaks again we can purchase the part needed instead of the whole product.\\n__label__1 13 gal touchless: Buyer Beware-The engineering is just terrible. The plastic gear that operates the lid is too small and broke early on, The battery compartment opens to the trash hence when the battery lid fails the lid and the batteries go out with the trash. Touchless sent me a new battery lid(10$ plus 4$ shipping) it smartly went out with the trash as well. After juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died. I now have a 100$ toy that doesn\\'t work and only did work for a total of 8 weeks.\\n__label__2 Time Tested: We have had ours for 4 1/2 years. It has served as our kitchen trash can in a busy home. I am back to buy another (my fault I broke it). Mine is in an area where people see it as they walk in. It is sharp-looking and free of bag overhang. My pets are not tempted to pull out trash since it is always contained. It has never malfunctioned. The only precautions I would pass along are that (1) it is easy to mistakenly dispose of the big plastic ring that hold the liner when one is taking out the trash; and (2) the plastic sheet covering the battery-pack fell off once and was carried away to the outside trash. I really hesitated when I purchased it ($$), but it turned out to be well worth it.\\n__label__2 Great Product: Love this trash can, works exactly as stated. Small enough to fit where I want and large inside. Have had no problems to date.\\n__label__2 I like it, works for me so far: Before I bought this, I read most of the reviews, positive and negative.most of them are true. So far I am happy with it.\\n__label__2 great trash can: A great kitchen trash can, opens immediately, sleek design and great capacity. Push the button to the right and the top stays open when you have your hands full of veggie peelings. My husband does not like the ring inside the can which hold the bag in place, he says its too timing consuming to replace the trash bag. Overall, its one of the better trash cans I have ever used in the kitchen.\\n__label__2 Love it: I really love my new \"auto trashcan\" I use it for recycling and it is quite busy and works perfectly.\\n__label__2 Perfect trash can: We purchased this trash can over a year ago. We really like it. Works very well, looks great, fits nicely in a narrow space. We changed the batteries after a year. I would highly recommend this product.\\n__label__2 Love this group: These guys are professionals and just totally great at what they do. They are truly world-class musicians and can adapt to any sound. If you haven\\'t heard any of their music - it is safe to say that you can pick up and CD of theirs and start listening and enjoying the music.\\n__label__2 SATISFIED USER: I bought this part to replace a damaged unit on my sons mountain bike. This deraileur is the same make and model as the damaged one. It was delivered as described in the original packaging in quick time.Easy to install and adjust, full instructions included. Works just as it should.\\n__label__2 Charm City\\'s Up & Coming....: This CD has six good tracks. But the one for the ladies is number 10\\'s \"Saying I Love You\".\\n__label__2 If you feel this album then just get it!: Dam! Music I played back in 91 while in 7th grade is like old school rap classics now. I like this albume still today in 2006. Dare I say it but it\\'s a fun album. I mean I know hip-hop now you got to be a \"THUG\" and all. This album just brings back good memories for me back in a time in 7th and 8th grade early 90s. The beats on this album still play to me and aren\\'t out dated. For example, I brought Ice Cubs\\' \\'The Predator\\' album just for the \\'Check Yo Self\\' track but all the other song beats on that album are mad out dated. I don\\'t know if your a young cat reading this or someone like me around 29, but this LP is just that good stuff! If you weren\\'t around in 91 you might not be feeling me, but tracks for example; Feminat Fatt, Sobb Story, Show Me a Hero, were just my songs along with many more on this LP. I don\\'t know, I just feel those good beats and the creativty on this album, still today!\\n__label__2 Don\\'t Need to Be a Plant Expert!: Although I very much enjoy books that simply educate me about certain plants, I am not able to remember all I need to know in a regular, timely fashion. This book, with its month to month format, overcomes that by reminding me to weed-n-feed my lawn, prune my summer flowering shrubs, plant bare root roses, and spray my fruit trees -- all in one chapter entitled, \"March\"! Also, great reading and pictures! Along with my Southern Living Garden Problem Solver book, I don\\'t need any other gardening books!\\n__label__1 Poor quality and pretty worthless: The box was a warning: it was cheap and not even square. The bits would not fit into the sockets, so it was nonfunctional. I sent it back for a refund.\\n__label__2 Good instrument: This has many available choices for watch backs. The watch back must have slots. It is very easy to adjust and removes the back without any problems. In time the cost of this item will save money in taking your watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced.\\n__label__2 A little small for a 9-inch pan: I bought this pan for Thanksgiving for making a particular dessert recipe that required a 9-inch square pan. I read the reviews here and knew it might be too small (and it was), but I thought it was so pretty that I could use it for other things if not for the dessert dish. It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige. I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It\\'s still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.\\n__label__2 Buy This One for One of the Best Song Ever Written: Caruso: There are three songs on this CD.If you have seen the PBS Special, you like me were blown away by the powerful performance. She took this beautiful, compelling song that her mother used to sing, and brought it to a new level. Andrea Bocelli\\'s and Pavarotti\\'s version of CARUSO are no where as fulfulling as the Emotionally Packed, Exquisitely Crafted Masterpiece. This song is Reforged TIMELESS. Like she says, when you heard her interpretation of this song, you see, feel, breath, touch the Culture, Soul, History and Essence of ITALY. Not a Breath was wasted. Every nuance, tone, blend of emotions fell into place. I hope when upon listening this song for the very first time, you will be lifted and transported to another place and time. It is truly an unreal experience. Furthermore, Italian is truly a beautiful, expressive language.I bid you Love and Peace.\\n__label__1 Contains Bad Assumptions and Poor Worldview: I have a few problems with the DVD.1. It assumes that CO2 is causing global warming something that is not scientifically proven. Global temperatures peaked in 1998 and have declined since.2. The DVD says that there is one thing worse than more people is affluence. The DVD believes that more people are bad. It is based on the belief that the earth can only support a certain number of people. People have been producing alarmist documents for 200 years warning of the impending limits on population growth. The earth could very well support 1 trillion people.\\n__label__2 TV throughout the room: this product allows you to turn a TV to almost any direction in a room. We have it mounted on the wall of our home office to allow viewing from the work area or from the relaxing area. It is well made and works great. if you are hesitant about installing then buy this and hire someone to install. just ensure you mount to studs and follow directions.\\n__label__2 Navy Seal reader: This book was really good. It focuses on several missions instead of one. The 4 main characters are easy to like and root for. Plenty of action. Looks like it will be a good new series in the Navy Seals area.\\n__label__1 Action reader: This Seal novel would be better if the writer had a good plot, missions are good but lack realism, team goes in and then out very little action and the spook is just not real. suggest writer add more story and action for both sides. Seals are not perfect all the time, even if they think they are. these missions are to perfect.\\n__label__1 sounds don\\'t work: i find this product to be lovely. i bought it some months ago for my baby and put it away until now that he is 7 months and we can play with it.but i just found out that the sounds of the bottom 2 rings don\\'t work!! i am so pissed off!!! this is such a pity.\\n__label__2 Must have for the serious notary.: I was impressed by the breath and depth of this book as well as by the practical examples. I picked up the book used on Amazon but would have gladly paid full price. I keep it in my bag since it serves as a great reference.\\n__label__2 Reprint of a classic: This is a reprint of a very good book by John White -- likely to take advantage of the \\'Prayer of Jabez\\' craze. While this book might not have the same popular appeal as \\'Jabez\\', I believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the Bible.Even 10+ years later, the observations and lessons from this book still remain true. If you haven\\'t thought much about prayer and God\\'s interaction with us through prayer, this is a great place to start.\\n__label__1 Broke on first use!: Used smallest pot in set, boiled water, got food out and left the water in pot while it cooled during super. Come back to clean and looked like someone tried to sit on it because the sides were cut at the top and it formed an oval. It still had the water in it, thus it was not someone sitting on it.\\n__label__2 good item: They worked great for the home canning i did. if i was in the restaurant business would need a heavy grade but for home is ok\\n__label__2 Shorter Christian Prayer/ the four week Psalter of the Liturgy of the hour: I enjoy this book completely, were I still have my pitfauts with the larger Christian prayer book this little book helps to make things much easier for me to read and understand. Now I\\'m still learning about how to use this tiny little book.but it is fast becoming one of those books that i reach for each morning and evening at prayer time. thanks it is a great little book to have at hand.\\n__label__2 Nice Size For A Purse.: This is a nice book for morning and evening prayers. It has a beautiful cover and is the right size to pit into a purse or bag to take on the go. This is a perfect book to start praying the Liturgy Of The Hours.\\n__label__2 This Fiberglass/Foam Board is a Good, Economical Upgrade from a Wood Board: I\\'ve been riding wooden boards for over 2 years now. I saw this board for sale and thought it was way too cheap for a full fiberglass/foam board - but I decided to take a risk and give it a try. It\\'s a major upgrade from my wooden boards. With this, I can waveskim or sandride. It\\'s very light weighing only 5 lbs, has a mild rocker, and comes with a limited lifetime warranty. It\\'s not going to perform as well as $200 - $300 namebrand boards like Victoria, Exile, Zap, etc.; but for the price I paid I\\'m very happy.\\n__label__2 Great Service: I received my purchase within 7 days of ordering it and as described. I will be using this vendor again!!!!!\\n__label__1 when faith is not enough: If you are looking for a universalist\\'s approach to dealing with doubt, then this is the book for you. Clark\\'s arguments completely miss the nature and cause of the majority of doubt that i have encountered (Pastor 25 years). To offer advice to Christians over and above Faith is not only foolish it is dangerous. Clark\\'s arrogant approach may work in the ivory tower, but for the rest of us, dont waste your time or money.\\n__label__1 Poor content, bad presentation: The movie itself is very run of the mill and humdrum.The video quality is slightly woolly and there are no subtitles or captions on the disc, so very poorly presented from a technical and accessibility standpoint.\\n__label__2 Makes studying economics easy! Thumbs up!: This book is well organized to help student learn macroeconomics. It has the best utilization of pedagogical features (not just graphs, captions and colors) I\\'ve ever seen. I found key term call-outs, section reviews, and keypoint outlines to be the most helpful. I appreciate the efforts of reducing the amount of reading necessary to understand the concepts.If you are not a lazy student, you will have lots of case studies, news analysis, econ puzzles, and biographies to broaden your breath. All these features are well organized so that you can read efficiently, thanks to the ingenious layouts.I am actually here to look for other books by Mr. Taylor to support my current textbooks.\\n__label__2 Great Alternative for Moms-to-be: This is a great book for parents-to-be who already use and believe in homeopathy. It is a little detailed for beginners. This should be required reading for every OB and Midwife. The case histories are wonderful!\\n__label__1 A book only the author\\'s mother could love: The people who gave this book a five star rating must be related to the author -- or maybe its the author himself. Honestly, as someone who has read almost every mafia book out there, this book is just so so. People should know that it focuses almost all of its attention on the New Jersey court case and not on the street action. Its more about lawyers and the justice system than it is about criminals and the street.\\n__label__1 you have to fill it with water: I didn\\'t know that when I bought it, so have not used it yet. It makes it less convenient to use.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t buy thru Deerso: The item works just fine, howevever, the buying experience thru Deerso was terrible. I paid extra for expedited delivery but after they shipped it they said it would still be seven days from the time I ordered until the time I got it. The customer service people totally didn\\'t care. I will never order anything thru Deerso again!\\n__label__1 Short Life: I have owned four of these. One for the motorcycle, one for the truck, and one each for the cars.The Good:These gauges are accurate, repeatable, and very small.The Bad:They are disposable. I get maybe a year out of them, which is perhaps 2 uses. I tried to replace the battery in one. It would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items. Inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place - nice touch. After I installed a new battery, reassembled the gauge, and turned it on, I discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me, perhaps pascals. I never did figure out how to change the units. The price of the product is not worth the time I put into it anyway.I don\\'t recommend this digital pressure gauge.\\n__label__1 Do not buy - same as other reviews SHORT BATTERY LIFE, TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE DISPOSABLE: Weak...bought for a bike trip and by the time the ride was over, the battery was dead. Very disappointed and waste of $20\\n__label__2 John has done it Once Again: John\\'s second effort is more than just G.O.O.D. its GREAT! When I first heard Once Again I wasn\\'t sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as \"Each Day Gets Better\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Where Did My Baby Go\", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like \"Stereo\", \"Again\" and \"Another Again\". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with \"Heaven\" and \"Show Me\". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won\\'t soon forget.\\n__label__2 Cut from the same cloth as Marvin Gaye: I anxiously awaited this CD after his first CD \"Get Lifted\" became a smash hit. I actually anticipated somewhat of a sophomore fall off of sorts. You must admit that 1st CD is a tough act to follow. After listening to this CD for a couple of times, I felt it was not quite up to the standard set by his 1st. I mean the 2nd song \"heaven\" and the 7th \"slow dance\" are instant classics in my opinion. But it wasn\\'t until I heard the CD several times, the 4th song \"show me\" and 6th \"p.d.a.\" started to really stand out. I believe as an artist he is as close as you get to the likes of Marvin Gaye. I just happened to hear \"Mercy Mercy Me\" by Marvin after listening to Legend. I found the likeness, striking. I\\'m not trying to say he is as great, yet, but he has the potential.\\n__label__1 Disappointed: Based on a Newsweek recommendation, I\\'m a first time Legend buyer. After listening once, I tried to listen again and found myself at Half Priced Books where my $10 investment became .75 cents. At least the McDonald\\'s coffee was good. The songs were smooth. Smooth as in flat, without interest or color. Were the words introspective and deeply meaningful? I don\\'t know, my attention kept wandering.If jazzy, soulful, romantic ballads are for you grab this one. Its just not for me.\\n__label__1 Copy-Cat: The song \"Save Room\" is almost exactly like the Classics IV \"Stormy.\" Listen to both and you\\'ll see. I thought John Legend was supposed to be good. Turned me off really bad.\\n__label__2 excellent product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! best price!!!!!!!!!!!: I purchased this product for my 55inch Phillips flat screen tv for my room.i just move into in a townhouse and just purchased my tv and needed wall mount. it came in like 2 days, i will say when i first received it and saw how small and light the box was i thought i got ripped off.I made my brother(who thought i should hire a professional to install it) install it for me. it took him about 2 hours to do it, but it turned out great. its now December(purchased in October) i have no issues at all with it. now my brother did go to best buy and purchased a wall mount for $60 something dollar and he now regret that he spent that much money on a wall mount, but men they just don\\'t listen lol.I can honestly say its a great purchased, if your not picky and just need a wall mount that works and is sturdy, then this is it. If i had let the negative reviews get to me then i would have regret it.love!!!! love !!!!\\n__label__2 Great Value: This is a good mount for the money. I used a professional to install mine and he commented that the mount was very good. It\\'s comparable to others that are much more expensive.\\n__label__2 47\" is hanging on it: My 47\\' is hanging on it, and it works great! Easy to install and easy to mount the hdtv. I have a Vizio. Dont know if that matters much but it works great!\\n__label__2 Good quanity at good price: Brought this for $29.99 after much research and I\\'m very happy with the result!I put up my 42\\'\\' Vizio LED TV with no problem.Pros:I like how hey give you different sizes of screws and universal washersMaterial: very sturdy, solid build.Installation: Much easier than I thought. The hardest part was finding the stud in the wall.Con:Only complain I have its the design of the TV mount leaves little space behind the TV. Not a big problem, just make sure to plug in your power cord and other cable before mounting the TV to the wall.\\n__label__2 Great wall mount: It was cheap and it works perfectly. I mounted it twice since I moved 3 months ago. IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out. I prefer that it does not stick out because I prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible. The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.\\n__label__2 For the price you can\\'t go wrong...: I used this to wall-mount my 46\" LED TV in my living room. My parents couldn\\'t believe I got a wall-mount for so cheap when they spent about 4 times as much on theirs! For the price, you can\\'t go wrong. It\\'s not the best mount, but it\\'ll do the trick on a budget. I previously bought a more expensive mount from a store which is what holds my 42\" LCD TV in the bedroom, and I will say that mount is better. The tilt feature on that is better, and unlatching it to take it off the wall (if needed) is easier than it is with this one. Tightening the screws at the bottom of this mount at the end of the installation process was kind of a pain.\\n__label__2 Happy: Installed for a 42\" samsung tv. Saved a ton of money not buying one in a store! So happy with this product. Im ordering a second one for our bedroom tv.\\n__label__2 Good TV Mount: I mounted a 55\" LCD TV to my brick fireplace with this item. No issues with the product itself although the instructions were absolutely pathetic. Shipping was very fast and package was in perfect condition. The free cable is o.k. for standard definition but certainly not for use with Hi-def!I would buy this product again.\\n__label__2 Great Economical Wall Mount: what a great deal on a wall mount! Why in the world anyone would pay double and triple the price of this wall mount is beyond me. The installation was simple and easy.......just follow the instructions that are enclosed with the mount. We mounted a 42\" Zenith plasma tv and did not have any problems.\\n__label__2 TV wall hanger: This bracket is sturdy. I liked the way the TV just hangs up before you tighten all the screws in the lower bracket clips. It takes a lot to lift the 52\" TV the six feet to the mount but if you can do that then you feel confident that it will not fall down. It took three men to lift the TV above the fireplace. It clipped right in and the rest was easy. I liked the way the TV can slide on the bracket from side to side and tilt to where you like it best.\\n__label__2 Very pleased: I have a 50 inch Panasonic and the mount worked perfectly. Easy to install and they provide screws for all surfaces you would mount to. You need to be able to find the studs in your wall, and once the TV is mounted plugging in new plugs is hard. It is best to plug things in before you put it on the wall. Mount works great though would recommend\\n__label__2 Perfect for my TV: I recently purchased a 60\" Plasma TV. I found this wall mount on Amazon. It worked perfectly. I can\\'t understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the SAME thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost. The quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy. Don\\'t waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen TV. Do it yourself and save a ton of money. I would highly recommend this product.\\n__label__2 Holding a 65\" plasma well: I bought this to mount our TV and it is working well. The only improvement I\\'d like to see is for screw holes closer to the middle, so that you can bolt through 3 sets of studs (left, center, and right) when mounting this to the wall...I added the holes to secure to the center stud myself. The level included with the kit...wasn\\'t - but I don\\'t count that as a big negative, as I would expect to have a good quality level myself for a job like this.\\n__label__1 embarrassing: Daniels\\' poetry is just prose, and his prose is, well, just slop. This book is just plain awful.\\n__label__2 Unique Approach to Bargello: I will not critique this book. I do not yet know if the directions can be followed or the advice given is useful. I have only just received my copy of this interesting book. I will tell you one thing, it is unique. The designs, the idea and the approach are original. I also can\\'t fault her color use.I am writing a lot of these reviews. As a buyer of these out-of-print books, I always wish there was more information about them out there. So, here I am. I am currently (ok, for almost a year now) working on a needlepoint project that has a saying *THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE*\\n__label__2 Colin Hay and the Genius of Herbie Hancock: Looking for Jack is a good record, and Colin Hay is such a talent. The title track is the gem here, in part because Herbie Hancock laid down perhaps the most brilliant piano track ever recorded on a pop song that few have ever heard. It compliments the song, the arrangement and Colin\\'s voice so well, yet at the same time it\\'s a song in itself. It flourishes with such a melodic playfulness, it makes the whole track irresistible.\\n__label__2 Work great!: Bought these for my 2005 subaru wrx jdm fog lights. they work great! They put out plenty of yellow light, which is much better suited for foggy conditions.\\n__label__2 exellent epic escapist science fiction: I can definitely count Kage Baker as one of my favorite authors (as well as Daniel Keys Moran and Dan Simmons). I have enjoyed all of the company novels and this was no exception. The storyline is quite complex and has some of the most well developed and intricate characters that I have ever read; they also possess a quality that most characters in novels recently have lacked: you actually care what happens to them and how they evolve! So to the person who said \"Baker may be losing his grip on the plot\" well ... first of all if you have truly READ the books you would know that Kage Baker is a LADY and second, the story is only expanding and becoming truly intricate. Thank you and good night!\\n__label__2 \"Kids, Lets Put On A Show.\": Love the movie and love the soundtrack! Although the soundtrack is exceptional, it is not without it\\'s share of problems. The soundtrack is jam packed with glam classics from Brian Eno, T Rex, Roxy Music, PULP, Lou Reed, Venus in Furs etc. Granted that the album is full of priceless glam classics it is not the COMPLETE SOUNDTRACK. I noticed that there are songs that are missing, for example there are two Brian Eno songs featured in the movie that where not in the soundtrack, amoungst others. Speaking of missing songs, it wouldn\\'t have botherd me a bit if they left out the songs coverd by Ewam Mcgregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I can\\'t believe they where allowed to tarnished an Eno number, and T.V Eye! Their vocals are pathetic! But what redeems the album is the PULP song, and the other glam classics. Not perfect, but a great soundtrack.\\n__label__1 Very uneven: I got this cd becasue one i am a fan of glam rock, it was a good price and i am a fan or radioehead. How can you have soundtrack that is about the glam rock scene of the 70s and not include bowie. All of the covers are not nearly as good as the originals. The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it.\\n__label__2 an accurate model of glam times: I really wasn\\'t crazy about the movie. But the Cd is really great. Shudder To think is the Danny Elfman of the late 90\\'s.Highlight tracks: TV Eye, a great cover of 20th century Boy, Satelite of Love and Baby\\'s on Fire is soo cool! I wonder if Bowie likes this CD?-Jules Cohen (lead singer of Spiritease)Brand New album available! \"multigenerational alter pop/rock\"\\n__label__2 Amazing: I had never hear of this movie or the soundtrack until I saw Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Gormenghast and had to watch all his movies. I at first found the movie strange, but it grows on you and the music is amazing. My favorites have to be Ballad of Maxwell Demon and The Whole Shebang. Even if you didn\\'t like the movie you have to love the music, especially if you love David Bowie music like I do.\\n__label__2 Must have gotten a bad batch: I\\'m only getting about 3 of 4 good copies from this set. I\\'ve used these before with only 2 or 3 bad disks in the set....not this time though.\\n__label__2 Product performed as expected: I have gone through about 300 disk recordings and none have failed. The fact that I have not had a disk to fail saves me time and money.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t work well in DVD player: I\\'ve had this problem before, but forgot and bought Memorex again. Recorded movies seem to work well in a computer, but on my DVD player they are unreadable. Probably about 1/4 of them were bad. You may suspect I have a bad DVD player, but I haven\\'t had any problems with other brands. There is always the possibility my DVD player is getting weak, but there\\'s no denying that so far I\\'ve only had problems with Memorex.\\n__label__1 Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker--broke third time used: I see that the Model 20 is no longer advertised. My experience with it is:Used it 3 times. Worked fine.Fourth time----- VERY noisy. But that isn\\'t my problem with it. After the ice cream was made (looked fine) I (and a strong man) could not \\'unlatch\\' the top! And we tried everything except a hammer.I would love to know if anyone else had that problem.\\n__label__1 Only worked for a short time!: I bought this new, and it worked great, UNTIL I made the mistake of taking the freezing bowl out of the freezer, to thaw out, and stored it for 1 week. When I refroze it a week later, it never made ice cream again, no matter how cold the freezer was or how long I kept it in there. I suspect that once you freeze it and keep it in the freezer, you MUST keep it in there from then on and NEVER thaw it out. I returned mine, but I will never buy this type of ice cream maker again for fear that it won\\'t work.\\n__label__2 Yukon Game Gambrel: I purchased a Yukon Game Gamble about 2 months ago prior to the Kentucky upcoming deer season. During my hunt, I killed a large 10 point buck with a bow and used the Yukon Game Gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal. This item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around 160 - 180 lbs with little to no effort. The instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly. This is definitely an item every hunter needs. I will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends. Thanks Yukon.... Rick\\n__label__2 Whaling: Whaling has a long and exciting history. There are chapters in this book on the Dutch and English whalers, the famous Yankee whalers, the Norwegian and Japanese whalers, and a special chapter on the whales themselves.\\n__label__1 Mis-represented: The \"Title\" of this item indicates it comes with 2 K Type thermocouple probes. In the manufacturers description it infers the probes range is to 1832 F. \"The truth is it comes with 1 type K probe only usable to 482 F\". The other mis-representation is that it comes with a protective Holster. The truth is it comes with an orange protective rubber over cover.I would like to see these inaccuracies corrected on the Amazon web site but cannot see a way to contact them.\\n__label__2 Flows beautifully--like an open wound: By the time I\\'d gotten to \"Slayer of Gods,\" I\\'d gobbled up the previous five in order, thereby attaining the level of anticipation of a hammerhead shark in a sea of Egyptian blood. I must say it was sheer pleasure to chomp through this one. Ms. Robinson is in the best narrative form of the whole series. There are no serious breaks in the flow and action and the whole meal was over in wink, leaving me still quite bloodthirsty for more. Don\\'t peek at any plot details! The previews reveal too much. I have to say that I figured this one out almost immediately, and I think you will too. But it\\'s wonderfully done from a dramatic and character perspective. I give it only four stars because, to me, the plot has a many holes. Enough to make me uncomfortable, and I\\'m not the fussy type. Nevertheless, a scrumptious --and very suspenseful-- gobble.\\n__label__2 Small but good: At 8 1/2\" it is quite small but it\\'s perfect if you\\'re just making eggs for yourself or something like that. Quick clean up and heats up fast as well.\\n__label__1 There is only one word to describe this book: tedious.: I made the mistake of buying several of the books in this series because the main character sounded interesting: an overweight, middle-aged PI, (i.e not your run of the mill detective). Unfortunately, the books turned out to be uniformly tedious! The entire book consists of an endless succession of \"witness interviews\" interspersed with minute descriptions of every meal this \"full bodied\" woman eats. (And she eats constantly!) When the main character tries to act \"cute,\" making what is intended to be humorous observations, she only comes off as irritating. I would definitely NOT recommend this series, unless you suffer from insomnia.\\n__label__2 Great Book: Loved this book. It is written so well that is makes you feel you are literally there at times experiencing exactly what Caro\\'s is describing. So very much worth getting and reading. And do not forget the other two books on LBJ that Caro wrote: Means of Ascent and Master of the Senate. The three are a trilogy with the Path to Power being the first one you should read. Well worth your time and money!!\\n__label__2 Outstanding. Highly Readable and Insightful. A Must Read!: This is a cherished book in our household, enjoyed equally by our history buffs and our novices. It is fascinating reading, and we cannot wait until the third volume is published!\\n__label__1 A historian\\'s analysis: Succinctly, the book is trash. It is another product of the Republican sleaze machine. Some good trees were ruined for nothing.\\n__label__2 Beethoven DVD Audio: Shipment prompt. Item as described. This DVD Audio will not become one of my favorites.\\n__label__1 a dissapointment compared to his last one .: what is this? Meth was so raw and hard-core on his first album and then this.i was really disapointed when i heard this.This was the one rapper i expeected to keep it real. and what the hell is with the cyborg gear?\\n__label__1 Slightly Enlightening: I was disappointed in the lack of content in this book. While I was slightly enlightened with what appear to be some interesting facts, I believe there could have been much more information, resulting in a much thicker book. I finished this in two quick sittings (about a 3.5 hour read). This was a rush job, without a lot of commitment to research. The last few artists barely get a mention. Randy Rhodes, the guitarist that resurrected Ozzy Ozborne\\'s career gets 1.5 pages??\\n__label__1 Miles, distorted in mono...again: This is a very simple, but straight forward review. All tracks are in MONO. However, that\\'s not the main problem with this CD. Tracks 3 (Teo) and 4 (Walkin\\') are very distorted during Mile\\'s heavy solos. This is truly a historic recording, but don\\'t waste your money. I paid $0.98 cents for it used and that was too much. I don\\'t want to waste anymore of your time reviewing this CD...just don\\'t buy it, take it from an avid Miles Davis collector.\\n__label__1 Simply Awfull: This is a terrible re-make of the original movie, which was quite good. What a waste of talent, stay away from this mish-mash of a movie.\\n__label__1 Oh, the horror!: Quite a tedious movie I must say. For fans of horror this film fails to show anything truly scary. Chris Kattan displayed some terrific acting though. But the whole idea was it to be scary and it failed to do that for me.\\n__label__1 DVD would not play through: I really liked this movie. I\\'ve been looking for it for a while. I Recieved the movie in the mail yesterday, I watched 1/2 of it before it started skipping. I\\'ve seen it a thousand times, but I would have liked to have what I paid for.\\n__label__2 Scarier than the Exorcist!: I have been a horror film fan for years and I haven\\'t came across a horror movie that has scaried me as bad as the Exorcist. This movie has out done the Exorcist and it will send chills down your spin.\\n__label__1 Why did I bother?: I kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters, but I never got around to it...I\\'m glad I didn\\'t. This movie was really bad. Most of the scenes just didn\\'t make any sense. The characters weren\\'t likeable at all, I couldn\\'t have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan\\'s character like, \"this house is alive, we\\'re all gonna die\" and \"you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it\". Thats the kind of bad script that I\\'m talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects. I would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given. All and all...don\\'t watch this movie.\\n__label__1 Very Disturbing: This movie has some very disturbing images in it. The plot started out well, but then just turned sick, the ending is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it never would have happened anywhere else, but Hollywood. A horrible movie.\\n__label__1 Talk About A Dive Of A Movie: Probably, the worst movie I ever saw. Not only did the plot diminish as the movie progressed, but the acting was ridiculous. This was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn\\'t even that scary. More or less, it was stupid and the idea was very unclear. After watching it, I couldn\\'t tell you what it was about. Well, Actually, it was about a house on haunted hill, but who didn\\'t know that already. 5 people visit it and I bet you can quess what happens from here. They die, amazing. Yeah right. What ever happens to you don\\'t and I mean don\\'t, see this disgrace of a movie.\\n__label__1 Awful: Sure, the original Vincent Price film was cheesy, but it\\'s a classic. This film is neither cheesy or a classic, it\\'s just plain BAD. I don\\'t understand what the draw to this type of \"horror\" is; it\\'s simply not scarry.Poorly made, bad acting, bad everything... don\\'t waste your time.\\n__label__2 Definitely worth a look...at Jeffrey Combs: Jeffrey Combs is underused here (like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in), but Director William Malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace, to hide the warts in the plot (like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs). This is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original. Not real scary, but if they had used more of Jeffrey Combs as the mad doctor, they really could have had something special.Bonus points for the DVD extras, which are excellent. Why would anyone use VHS at this day and age? Go DVD and see this movie in all of its glory.\\n__label__1 not even woth renting: is this movie......what is the word? sure it is bloody and gross but there is no story line and it is boring thru out. what was the point? They tried to make it interesting with all the bloody scenes and the killings but it turned out to be stupid and really unwatchable. What was supposed to be a scary good movie turned out a bad, silly, movie.\\n__label__2 DELIGHTFUL: This is a really easy to read book. Very matter of fact and as it\\'s written by Michael Jackson himself it is a real joy. It\\'s a very nice looking book as well and I particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader. It\\'s delightful. It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to \\'hear\\' Michael Jackson\\'s version and intepretation of various events, which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson\\'s interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids\\' interpretation of Michael Jackson\\'s world.\\n__label__2 A Must Read For Any MJ Fan: This is Michael in his own words. I couldn\\'t put it down. If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also \" The Magic and the Madness \" By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian. But most people forger that and want to focus only on the negative and what the media says. Michael was one of the greatest entertainers of music history and there will never be another like him.\\n__label__2 Beautiful book by a beautiful man!: This book is incredible! If you really want to know Michael Jackson..this will tell you what you need to know.\\n__label__2 Touching and humerous yet helpful for those seeking answers: I have just finished reading this theraputic and helpful book For Those Who Love Time is Eternal. It relates to common everyday problems that happen within relationships and has witty, thought-provoking and helpful meditations to soothe the soul. It doesn\\'t give answers but it helps you find answers within yourself. It has daily meditations for: jealousy, simple interest,body language, and not having the ability to read minds. I really enjoied this book and recommend it for everyone-Krystal Clairson\\n__label__2 Complete list: This may be in the incorrect order, but these are all the episodes.1.Have You Seen This Snail?2.Rock Bottom3.The Great Snail Race4.Reef Blower5.Good Neighbors6.Krabs vs Plankton7.Lost Matress8.Skill Crane\\n__label__2 yay by hilfan90210 from l.i.n.y.: i luv sb! the episodes are:have you seen this snail?good neighbors (whatz wit da phezez?)the great snail race (how did tentacles turn into torlini?)skill crane (y kant i win 1?)the lost mattress (y prime cutz?)&krabz vs. plankton (can some1 tell me wat happend)what happend 2 dat doctor guy shown in seasons 1-3? he wasnt in funny pants & now i think bout him & itz DRIVING ME INSANE!!!!!\\n__label__2 Great looking watch: Couldn\\'t be more pleased with the look and performance of this watch. The only drawback is that the date is a little difficult to set. Other than that, excellent purchase.\\n__label__2 I love it, love it, love it!!!: Best watch out there for a female. It is elegant, cute and goes with everything! I got this watch as a Valentines Day gift 3 years ago...I absolutely love it! No mechanical problems at all. I hope Seiko makes the same watch but with their new Kinetic technology. This is definitely worth the buy from Amazon because local dealers charge the full price. You wont be disappointed with this purchase. The picture does not do it justice.\\n__label__1 So Bad It\\'s Funny!: Billonaire Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) arranges a party at the abandoned Vannacutt Psychiatrist Institute for the Criminally Insane (in short, House on Haunted Hill). The Institute was once the site of the most horrifying medical experiences in history. Price announces that anyone who manages to spend an entire night in the house will win $1,000,000! He has secretly rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of staying, but his tricks soon become meaningless, as thr mansion begins to generate terror on its own. Before their night of terror is over, the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum.House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin\\' terrible script. It is equally terrible with The Haunting, 1999\\'s other so-bad-it\\'s-funny try-hard 1999 horror.\\n__label__1 Poorly written, poorly edited: Although I did learn a lot about Millard Filmore from this book, I think the presentation was flawed. It contains many errors, repetitions, and examples of bad editing. The author is one of those few people (mostly from the south) who insist that the Civil War wasn\\'t about slavery and he brings this up several times. This detracts from his credibility. Though it was written quite recently, it reads as if it was written in the late 19th or early 20th century.\\n__label__2 Pure Ear Candy: I too bought the tape when it first came out and WORE IT OUT. I just paid a lot for the CD (used) and it was worth every bit of it. How exciting to be listening to this album again. Love it.\\n__label__1 Horrible!!!: This is the worst hair removing system ever!! It pinches your skin horribly and does not remove the hairs. You have to continue going over and over the same hairs and for sensitive areas ( armpits, bikini) it is far too painful to even use. Save your money.\\n__label__2 Epilady Lengend Purchase: I purchased the Epilady Legend on Amazon.com for a Christmas present. I had already used this product and was very happy with it so I decided to purchase it for my daughter. It is a great item. The service I received from Amazon was also great, the item shipped in time for me to give it as a Christmas gift.Thanks Amazon.Rita\\n__label__2 Better than waxing any day.: I used to have an older style epilady and loved it but this new model is even better. It has lots of little tweezers that rotate and pull your hairs out. It takes a minute to get used to using it before your skin becomes desensitized but it\\'s not that bad. The results leave you with smooth skin,no nubs and no more shaving for 3-4 weeks.\\n__label__2 Good product: I have used Epilady for about 10 years. This one was bought as a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter. I am hoping to spare her many years of distress.\\n__label__2 Cordless Epilady - great product: I was using the old coil type Epilady that I had purchased years ago on my underarms. It worked okay, but it had a cord that developed a short after many years of use so I needed to replace it. I purchased the cordless Epilady and I love it. I have used it at least a half dozen times and it still doesn\\'t need to be recharged. It does a good job and it is reasonably painless. It is very compact.\\n__label__1 Domenick\\'s Opinion: Boring. Slow. Predictable. Saving graces? Great Italian scenery, which you might as well concentrate on as the movie doesn\\'t deseve that much attention. Even with his subtefuge I still don;t see why they woiuld becomne freinds with Matt Damon\\'s charchter considering he came across as a stupid twit. Mr. Damon is a good actor so it must have been the directors perception of the role. Overall a waste of time.\\n__label__2 it\\'s ok.....: My 2.5 yr old loves thomas, he has great hand eye coordination, so i thought we would try this game, even if his 4.5 yr old sister had to help. Ok so the game graphics are definately rough, and so are the voices. Both kids were very frustrated along with me on the lack of control in turning thomas down different tracks. as you are \"driving\" thomas a small screen in the corner shows a map with blinking lights of where you need to go next (along with an arrow) but getting thomas to turn is not easy. other than that it cute, and a pretty easy concept for the game. and well it\\'s thomas!! so my son is happy.\\n__label__1 Weak: Young, inexperienced no-names are invited to get beat up on by the Gracie\\'s best. I felt bad for these guys. Gracies are shameless.\\n__label__2 A good documentary on early years of MMA: A good look at the life inside and outside of the ring of an mixed-martial-art contestant, Rickson Gracie. His family helped popularize the concept of MMA competition for North American audiences with the debut of the Ultimate Fighting Champsionship back in 1993 in Denver, Colorado. Even though Rickson is probably the strongest Gracie in terms of physical and technical abilities, the family chose Royce to compete in UFC to demonstrate that a physically small person can defeat much larger opponents using superior grappling techniques.If you\\'re a fan of MMA, this is a good DVD to watch to see how competition has evolved over the years.\\n__label__2 Rickson Gracie, just one reason to buy this movie: This movie is exactly what the american public needs to see!They don\\'t respect our sport, its sometimes dubbed as being \"so brutal its nauseating\".The movie shows it not just dumb weight lifters who jump in a cage and beat the hell out of each other.Men who have trained most of their lives, dedicated to their disipline need somewhere to show their skill. They turn to the world of NHB combat.This movie depicts the best fighters(although i share the same feelings with others reviwers about Todd Hayes and Koichiro Kimura not being as great as they are showed to be)talking about training, their feelings about fighting, their art, even dying in the ring.If your a fan of NHB combat or Rickson Gracie this video is a must see!\\n__label__1 onclear: why is this book not updated??? drug companies are constantly changing prescription drugs...so what is correct today might be wrong a year from now..this book should be pulled off the shelves!!\\n__label__2 puzzled about editor: why is the editor of this book listed as Andrew j. Buda in the search and Brenda Adderly in the link?\\n__label__2 Great Basic Coffee Maker: This is a great coffee maker if you\\'re looking for something easy to use and programmable. Also for the price it is a great deal.\\n__label__2 Great coffeemaker for the price!: Just purchased my third and fourth Michael Graves\\' Coffeemakers. My husband and I go through a lot of coffee--from making up his thermos in the morning--to keeping the pots going up until the time we go to bed. We wore out the first two--the heating plates do tend to give out--but that\\'s my only criticism. The coffee tastes great, I love the styling and the no drip pour spout of the decanters.In my opinion, for the price, it\\'s the best value out there.\\n__label__1 Overflows and makes a mess: I bought this coffee maker specifically for the removable water reservoir. However, I\\'d much prefer the mess made by a non-removable reservoir to having coffee and grounds all over the counter. If the basket doesn\\'t seat JUST and the carafe isn\\'t pushed to the front right of the warming plate the pause-and-brew will engage and the whole thing overflows. This seems to be happening about once a week, despite our efforts to line everything up just so. I would not walk but run from this model.\\n__label__1 I wanna love this machine: I like the way it looks and love that I can remove and replace the water reservoir thing,but it is very finicky, to the point that I was just thinking about replacing it after only a couple weeks.It\\'s fine when it works but every thing about it has to be just so or the coffee won\\'t drip. & the way it is designed, it is unclear that there is a problem until it\\'s not making coffee. I\\'ve been using drip machines for over 20 years and never had this kind of issue before. I think it\\'s the machine.\\n__label__1 Lasted 8 months: I purchased this coffee maker last July and it\\'s now not working.Used Daily. Worked well initially. Anyone else have issues with short product life?\\n__label__1 Needlessly hard and difficult to use: I consider this book a major disappointment. Much of the material is well-presented, but too many words are used in the exercises (and in the dialogues of each lesson) that do not turn up in the glossary in the back. I find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary. Some of the grammatical explanations are good, but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them. Even after working through the book and tapes I don\\'t feel at all confident in even simple conversation. Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow. I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users- a book that purports to be a \"teach yourself book\" should be much more self-contained. It should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references.\\n__label__1 A decent...albeit real basic book: As a beginners book it wasn\\'t bad, but I was expecting something new or more advanced that I\\'ve read in better books previously.AdvancedMacking.Com and How to be the jerk that women loveare much better books than this one.\\n__label__2 A morally chilling novel of suspense.: Vachss shows he has literary guts in this Burke novel,where our anti-hero is hunting down a cult that preys onchildren and trains them for murder. Burke will have toconfront his deepest demons, and question the morals ofhis vigilantism in this excellent novel.\\n__label__2 The Cerebral Detective: This series ages well, perhaps because of the 1930s setting, and it is a change of pace from the slam bang action of American detective shows. It creates more mental stimulation than emotional, without the soporific effect of many Brit detective shows.\\n__label__2 poirot: Watch it daily and Love it. A bit more stimulating in regard to the investigations involved and intriguing in the manner portrayed.\\n__label__1 Cheaply Made: I can see why this rack is so inexpensive. It\\'s very cheaply made, with splinters of wood hanging off of it. The parts are connected with staples, too! Very shoddy workmanship. I really only wanted the utensil drainer, so I\\'m happy with that. My old rack is much better quality, so I\\'ll keep it and toss this piece of garbage. It\\'s not worth spending money to send it back.\\n__label__1 Way Too Complicated: I usually cook everything from scratch and don\\'t mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one recipe in this book, you\\'d need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn\\'t worth the effort - no one took seconds.\\n__label__2 Comprehensive look at formal hors d\\'oeuvres: This is an incredibly beautiful book. Not only will you enjoy looking at the fabulous pictures, but you will also be inspired as you browse through it planning a party. Be forewarned, however, that almost all of the recipes in this book are geared towards very formal settings. If you\\'re looking for quick, satisfying and tasty appetizers to whip out when friends stop by, this is not the book to turn to. Nevertheless, it is very thorough in discussing the various kinds of hors d\\'oeuvres and the elements of each. This makes it great for home cooks looking for a little education, and if you ever give a formal party, this would be the perfect book to use.\\n__label__1 Replacement transducer: This transducer performs well for fishfinding but was advertised as having a temperature sensor. It doesn\\'t work! It would cost too much to uninstall and return so I just kept it. My trolling motor does have a temp sensor when hooked to the same finder. Temperature is most important to me when bass fishing so I am not too worried, disappointed but not worried.\\n__label__2 Affordable and what I needed: Had a good price and I was able to determine exactly what I needed. It was shipped on time and matched up like I had hoped\\n__label__2 A lot less intimidating than he looks: Despite the goth-punk getup Jean Beauvoir sports in the cover photo, fans of noisy, hard-driving rock are not going to find it here. Instead, Beauvoir, whose voice recalls that of Mic Murphy of techno-funk duo The System, lays down a good solid set of sunny, upbeat power-pop and a couple of well-crafted, nicely polished pop ballads. Though not well known for his own recordings, JB has had a long tenure in the music industry, and he has worked with a prolific and diverse mix of artists including legendary hard rockers Kiss and doo-wop vocal group The Flamingos (whom he sang with for a short time).\\n__label__2 Powerful and refreshing angle on Holiday favorites. Get it!: Gather powerhouse musicians, an orchestra, choir, and writer Rob Mathes, and what do you get? You get an incredible seasonal masterpiece of songs only available, until now, to select audiences. Rob Mathes has made a name for himself in the New York area as a powerful singer/song writer, who really knows how to put on a show. With his guest musicians Vanessa Williams, Michael McDonald, and David Sanborn, he has created a live CD that every household should have throughout the holidays! Keep it coming!\\n__label__2 Simply the Best!: Stumbled upon the PBS airing of this Christmas Special in 98\\' and fell in love! What a musician![...] This is our favorite Christmas cd and we too have been known to listen to it all year. Just sit back, relax and oh yeah, don\\'t forget to turn up the VOLUME!\\n__label__2 How quick do you want it?: Product was recieved very quick. Just one order, click and it is on the way. Great way to do business!Wish everything in life could go so smoothly.\\n__label__2 Sad story of one of show biz\\'s most dysfunctional families: If you want to know what could possibly lead Michael Jackson to think there is nothing inappropriate about sleeping with young boys in his bed, read this book! As much as I admire Michael\\'s top-notch performances and his discipline as an entertainer and businessman, I am saddened by his poor judgement as a parent, his inability to deal with his sexuality in appropriate ways, his inordinate plastic surgery, and his general fear of the adult world with the responsibilities it entails. I can agree wholeheartedly that his childhood is worse than that of Christina Crawford\\'s \\'Mommie Dearest\\', and that his father will have so much to account for on judgement day for the nightmare he put all of his children through. But what\\'s really sad is that this man has more than enough money to invest in some serious counseling, and he WON\\'T get it. Tarborelli should publish an updated version of this book immediately.\\n__label__1 Fun Projects for You and the Kids: David Stiles: The book is extremely vague. I thought the book would contain plans to construct forts, playhouses, etc. This is not the case. The book has drawings with a few overall dimensions, but lacks specifics. It does not contain plans, materials lists, etc. This is not a \"how to\" book.\\n__label__1 Sucked: Couldn\\'t get it to work. It had nothing to do with my PC. Runnning an Alienware PC couldn\\'t figure it out but didn\\'t bother to figure it out. It was a cheap game.\\n__label__1 Lousy Support: this game does not load on the most common video cards. I am a Microsoft Partner, etc. and can\\'t even get the game to load and run properly. Over a dozen documented contacts to tech support never get replies. To date, it has been 3 months and I have given up on the product and support.\\n__label__1 i cant play this game: i bought this game and now i have no way to play it because my grapgics card isnt good enough and amazon makes it imposable to make a return because they hired an idiot to design thier site, anyone who wet to a computer career school know that a contact number and email should be visamle and easy to find from the home page... i cant find a number or email at all\\n__label__1 Poor Chrome Plating: This product does what it is intended to do, however the chrome plating on the tool was done poorly. Now the plating is flaking off in little tiny pieces that look like little metal shavings all over my garage floor. Overall this tool is low quality and a poor addition to my collection. I would not recommend this product.\\n__label__2 If you haven\\'t seen it, you are missing out!!!: If there is one television show you can make time for this is the one. You will not be disappointed!! You will want to thank me.\\n__label__1 Its Jerry Springer in a hospitol.: In this show, every doctor sleeps with one another, every doctor has had surgery on themselves in the hospital, Gray and Mc dreamy have done nothing but break up and get back together, every man is a complete pussy, doctors holler at there patients, there is no punishment for murdering patients, and everyone cheats on there spouses. Yeah this show is complete crap.\\n__label__2 Grey\\'s Anatomy: This is one of my must see shows. I enjoyed viewing the season in its entirety. They advertised 19 unaired scenes, and I don\\'t think that there were quite that many, so I was a little disappointed with that part.\\n__label__2 Awesome: Loved watching the beginnings of one of the greatest shows on TV! Can\\'t wait for the 2nd season to make it to DVD in Sept.!\\n__label__2 Good stuff: I am a physician so a lot of the medical matter makes me wince and I bear it. Yet, there are those moments in every episode when I see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations. That is when I almost forget that I am looking at more of the same sorta St.Elsewhere/ER \"let\\'s play doctor\" trash. This isn\\'t trash....it is entertainment.The cast is almost believable !\\n__label__2 Great viewing.: I only discovered Grey\\'s Anatomy part way through the second season, so this was essential viewing for me! What a fantastic cast! Totally enjoyed it, and have now ordered Season 2.\\n__label__1 If it worked, It might be nice: I had CC:Bridge Too Far, and loved it. I bought this with hopes of more maps, and more weapons. My issue is I have a new Intel4 PC, and it runs everything else fine, but CC:IN takes about 2 seconds (sometimes more) before my <Click> has a reaction (ie. selection, conformation, placement, etc). With such simple graphics, and game-play, it should be Instant.If anyone knows how to fix this I will update my review, but at this point the game is unplayable.\\n__label__1 buyer beware: If you have the most recent version of WordPerfect, beware, this product will not install the WP8 language module on a Windows 98 platform. Apparently NT and 95 will do, but not 98. They couldn\\'t mention this in the advertising? Duh?\\n__label__2 real numbers: I\\'ve found these batteries to be WELL worth the money. They are comparable to a good Heavy Duty (Non-Alkaline) set of batteries. I have a program on my palm pilot called FPSUtil3.5 that allows me to track the battery power curve over time:They don\\'t hold a top end charge for very long: 85% after only 30 minutes But they really hold up well after that: 68% after 2 hrs & 15 minutes (10 minutes of nightlight) - 54% after 3 hrs - 40% after 5 hrs - 38% after 8 hrs (15 minutes of nightlight) - 28% after 10 hrs - 18% (battery warning)after 11 hrs 30 minutesSo, after 11 hours and 30 minutes of power on over a 6 day period with 25 minutes of nightlight use, they are ready for a 5 hour charge... NOT BAD, seeing as to how I\\'m supposed to be able to charge them 1000 times. I think I\\'ll get my money out of them... ; )\\n__label__2 These batteries saved me a lot of money: I purchased 2 pairs of these batteries for my Palm Pilot IIIx because I was sick of spending a lot of money for non-rechargeable alkaline batteries. And I found them very reliable. There is no possibility of leakage with these batteries, because they are Nickel metal hydride, and they provide a large amount of energy for my Palm Pilot. Using them, I never found myself with empty batteries on the road. They are much better than NiCd batteries because they provide more then double mAh, and they do not loose their capacity with time. I would not trust any other batteries to keep my data safe, but Energizer. I use them in combination with Energizer charger for NiMH and NiCd battery family.\\n__label__1 Not as great as i expected them to be: I am using these for my MP3 player. I have a 1GB Creative Nano Plus. Even after a complete charge the player does not show all 3 bars for the battery strengh on the display. i can see all 3 bars with regular batteries. They last for a little lesser time than these batteries. I would recommend on trying the Sony rechargeables. They are the same price for 4 AAA batteries.\\n__label__2 anyone know a date?: does anyone know an approximate date for release of the box set? we have been waiting as well my whole family records the shows on dvr and its full... i like to go back and rewatch them but I dont have any more room\\n__label__2 Cold Case: I just started watching this show earlier this year. I can\\'t believe I hadn\\'t noticed it before. There was a daylong marathon of Cold Case on tv and it held my interest all day and into the night. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The way they intertwine the past with the present is brilliant, the plots are gripping and of course the music is the finishing touch. This show should be on DVD. It would be well worth the money as long as they keep the original format with the music. Great show with a great cast.\\n__label__1 No way to remember a giant.: The music is, to be kind - fair. Jimi is worth 3 stars but I have to subtract one star for Buddy Miles playing - boooooring. Where was Mitch Mitchel when you needed him? I LOVE Hendrix I own all the records and repurchased the music on cd later. I was inspired to play guitar because of Jimi and later the Allmans. Like most guitar players I have spent hours coping Jimis songs. Despite my honest worship of Jimi, much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts. He recorded \\'live\\' in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or. In addition, his affection for partying and showmanship took center stage and often overshawed his playing. Want a great live recording - listen to Red House recorded \\'live\\' in studio by the great Edie Krammer.\\n__label__1 Hendrix - Live At The Fillmore: There are far too many interviews and not nearly enough film footage of the concert(s). Who cares what Lenny Kravitz thinks...he\\'s making a living ripping off Hendrix. His opinion is worthless. Eddie Kramer is the only one who\\'s comments matter apart from Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. There must be tons of concert footage they didn\\'t use...why??? They should have shown much more of the band playing and it would have been fabulous!\\n__label__1 Good guitar, not so good seller: The Bass guitar package we received was not anything like the picture or description. We ended up having to buy another amp to go with the guitar, as the one they sent was nothing like the one pictured and it was not compatible with the guitar. The seller was very slow to respond to our complaint and they lacked any type of customer service. In all fairness, the guitar is agood beginner model for our grandson.\\n__label__2 Very Enjoyable: I recently bought this book, and I can tell you...what a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon! I would have given the title 5 stars if it had gone into greater depth on some of the subjects, but hey...it is 100 of the World\\'s Greatest Mysteries, they\\'ve got a lot of ground to cover here. This is not an in depth exploration of life\\'s deeper meanings. This IS a brief telling of great mysteries that skips, like a rock on still water, from subject to subject. Purely entertaining, light reading, and a truly enjoyable vacation for the mind. Enjoy...\\n__label__1 Shirt Mistake: The shirt is advertised correctly as 173rd Airborne Brigade shirt but according to the pictures in the advertisement it says 173rd Airborne Division on the shirt and that is wrong!!!\\n__label__2 A lesson in improvisation: I remember reading a review of some posthumous Hendrix that stated \"latter Hendrix is only for the staunchest\". I disagree and this disc proves it. Hendrix in his last year or so really started exploring the guitar.He was not sitting still... He was getting into jazz, jamming with Miles, Roland Kirk, etc. - ready for the next step.I\\'m old enough to remember how boring the jazz-rock scene was in the 70s, but if Hendrix had lived he might have taken it to new (non-boring)levels.I love the improvisations on this disc. - dash of flamenco here, some Wes Montgomery there - wonderful stuff. Yes, he was exhausted, but hell I wish I could play like that when I\\'m fully alert! Any student of guitar and music should view this show.\\n__label__1 A complete waste of time, budget and poor acting: First of all... The producers know nothing about Bogota and Colombia in general. They show Bogota as a poor tropical crap (as usual by many US producers/directors) and I\\'m tired of this. Bogota is a beautiful 10 million people city located at 2,700 meters over the sea level, so it\\'s a cold weather city/metropoli and not that tiny hotter than hell town shown in the movie.Very bad acting and stupid argument and dialogs.Don\\'t get me wrong... I was born in Canada but I live in Colombia and I liked the past movies of the series, but this one is a big garbage and I will not waste my hard earned money on this. You\\'ll not see accurately what Colombia really is and what happens here in this nice country so I recommend not to waste money on this nastiness.\\n__label__1 Trash: I sat through the entire movie, hated it from the start, and hated it even worse at the end. The first movie I have just thrown away.\\n__label__2 Nothin\\' to lose, nothin\\'s for free, can\\'t stop now iGot....: Bitches & Money by Buckcherry is a MUST HAVE for any hardcore fan.ART: The artwork on this EP is PHENOMENAL! There is a lovely collage of live shots of the band in the insert and it contains all the lyrics in both English and Japanese--a very well put together package.MUSIC: It contains \\'Porno Star,\\' from the Time Bomb LP as well as a b-side and Dramarama cover from that album, \\'Anything, Anything (I\\'ll Give You).\\' The second track can also be found on the Road Trip Official Sound Track. As for the three live tracks, \\'Time Bomb,\\' \\'You,\\' and \\'Place in the Sun,\\' they are from a broadcast of Rockline in Los Angeles (to the best of my knowledge). The band sounds great on the tracks, and those three tracks alone make it worth having, as they are not available on any other Buckcherry recording.\\n__label__1 Absolutely untrustworthy!: As another reviewer wrote, \"buy it used and buy it cheap.\" Well, I did, and _still_ feel cheated. After receiving it just this afternoon, and spending 15 minutes scanning through it, I have to say that TAB publishers, producer of this 3rd edition, obviously needs to clean house in their proofreading department, and the author, Joseph J. Carr needs to pay more attention to the galley proofs when they\\'re sent out. Missing diagrams, wrong diagrams to match the diagram\\'s text, and just plain wrong information renders this book untrustworthy, and therefore worthless. Amazon won\\'t let me award zero stars so I am forced to give it one.\\n__label__1 bells,whistles and aggrevation: chessmaster has chosen not to upgrade or patch 5500.this was a fairly simple chess engine that does what a chess program engine should do. set up the board, set the level of play you desire and play chess.set your timer if thats what you want .try and play cafe style chess with 8000.i do not want to spend my time reading a manual or switching disks nor do i give a damn about josh putzke learning centers ,quizes,rating evaluations,personalities (keep it simple stupid._ kiss\\n__label__1 Raghuraman: Not a good Chess engine. Try Fritz 6 or Shredder or Junior 6, they play much better game than this program.Shredder is the current World Chess Champion (machine). I am not sure whether ChessMaster was ever tried for World Championship. Programs like Fritz 6, Deep Fritz are used for enjoying the game and at the same time used by experts for anotating & analyzing Games. Fritz 6 was extensively used to analyze games being played during Fide World Championship etc.Bugs, crashes are not heard of those programs. They run on all the Windows OS. You get very decent programs on these sites.\\n__label__1 The Big Chill: If I can\\'t buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won\\'t buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can\\'t this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases?\\n__label__2 Jerry Bruckheimer scores another sixer: The success key to all Jerry Bruckheimer films is the brilliant music score. Stuff the songs. The score is what makes a film. Be it Hans Zimmer, Trevor Rabin, Mark Mancina or Harry Gregson Williams... The guy knows what\\'ll go. Enemy of the state starts off with a perfect theme which gets you into the action mood, then takes you deeper into the emotional mood. Not very artistic, but it\\'s commercial score at a very high level. Go Jerry Bruckheimer!!!\\n__label__1 Not as good as I hoped: This unit does not have the clean and clear sound that I hoped. The adjustment of bass and treble could not achieve a good EQ overall. The volume limit is also relatively low. I have owned the Yamaha MCR series and this does not compare to those systems in terms of sound quality, rounded sound, volume or ability to drive nice headphones. After six months I decided to buy another Yamaha.\\n__label__2 Great quality sound: I bought the Onkyo 315 due to the great quality of sound I got in my recently purchased Onkyo Home Theater and I couldn\\'t be happier. I am becoming a fan. I have found out that Onkyo receivers and amplifiers offer a variety of solutions that compete with most expensive devices. Onkyo is an affordable great quality of sound brand.\\n__label__1 Actually, this gets no stars!: Just read what \"A viewer from USA\" wrote (aug 2). To the point.This movie is offensive.\\n__label__2 Little Bear\\'s Band: Little Bear DVD\\'s are the next best thing to reading a story to a child...sometimes you just don\\'t have the time. Little Bear is there to buy you some peace and quiet and entertain any preschooler with simple story lines.\\n__label__2 I just love it!!: It is just so meaningful to me and i love the wonderful part of the past it reminds me of my great grandmothers kitchen on sat. morning,in S.F. Calif. in the 1950s growing up ,Pearl may Penninger was her name and at the time, i never knew how much that women would impact my life!!\\n__label__1 too much postage for book: \"Old_Time Farmhouse cooking: Rural American Recipes and Farm Lore\" I was disappointed in the size of the book and definitely the cost of postage for such a small book.\\n__label__1 Waste of Money, Waste of Space, Waste of Time: This game has got to be the single most poorly designed RPG on the market. And I\\'m not even taking into account the plethora of bugs that it has. The interface cripples the game well enough, if you ask me.The ranger class is rendered totally useless, or at least no more useful than a fighter with a bow.. since you can\\'t move any characters in your party very far away from the rest of your party at all.The story is very generic, and extremely lame. Basically.. you\\'re dumped in some ruins with very little explanation, and you wander around killing things. And wishing the interface [wasn\\'t so] bad.Don\\'t buy this game. (...)\\n__label__1 Don\\'t even think of buying this now...: Game is loaded with bugs. After 5 hours of play can\\'t save without being dropped to the desktop. Installer works only on it\\'s C:\\\\program files\\\\... etc. installs only in the default dir no matter where you set it to. Unplayable at this point. I\\'m returning mine and wait for a stable release. Yes I would like to buy it again and play it once it\\'s fixed.Want more ? Go to www.poolofradiance.com \"tech\" forum and search for \"roster\". I can\\'t even begin to describe the rest of the bugs, you have to visit their site before buying. That is the best $... advice I can give you all.Piece of unfinished ....I\\'m running AMD 1.33 Ghz ASUS A7MDDR 512mb U160 SCSI drives. Technical field as a profession.This game is unfinished. UBI SOFT starts to give me a scary feeling whenever I see it on any game box.UNFINISHED!\\n__label__1 Sloooow and boooring: I have really been looking forward to a new SSI D&D game. A good old fashioned dungeon crawl with awesome graphics sounded like a lot of fun. It should be. It really should be.It isn\\'t. The problems?The customization of characters is very limited. You get to create four cookie cutter characters. You might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it. The game action is terribly slow. It takes forever to get anywhere. By the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can\\'t stand it. I bought this game the day it came out and I have been trying to like it every since. I have just given up. That\\'s $40 I will never see again. Oh well lesson learned.By the way the music is pretty good and the movement (slow as it is) is fluid and life-like. I also have had no problems with crashes but then I have a fairly high end system.I wouldn\\'t buy this game unless you are a very patient person. I reccomend instead Baldur\\'s Gate II.\\n__label__1 Do not buy this game yet, wait until next year.: First and formost, this game is buggy, and has even destroyed some OS when trying to uninstall. I got mine to run and played it for about 10 hours. During this time the game slowed to a halt about 12 times. A patch would resolve this problem, but the game also suffers in gameplay. All the hoot and holler about being the first 3E computer game for D&D; can be forgotten, they butchered the rules. But there is good news, if you look past the bugs and the fact that this is not the game I was looking forward to ( A D&D; 3E game ! ), I think a great RPG might be in there somewhere. But wait until they fix the darn thing!Update: It has been about 3 months since the games release and the big patch (1.3) is not out yet. Wait until next year when (If? ) they get it fixed, it will cost less then ($) by then.\\n__label__1 Slow gameplay and Game crashes: I am a huge fan of the original gold box games and was hoping this would be a revamp of those. Although the turn based combat is reminicent of those old beloved games that is where the simularities end. The navigation system is terrible and slow. The combat is slow, and there is not enough random action....\\n__label__1 Should not have been released: I purchased this game and assumed it was finished, it was not. I set up my system with a minimal amount of space on C: drive, and this program must be installed on C:. Even if you download the patch, the installer still looks for enough space on C: to install. I wish I could give you a review of the actual play of the game, but like I said I will not be able to play it until Ubisoft puts out another install patch, or I re-partition my system(not likely, either one). Unless you have lots of space on your C: drive (minimum 630 MB), don\\'t get this, you\\'ll never be able to install.\\n__label__1 If I were you I\\'d pass on this one...: I played the original Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64 back in 1989. Naturally, I\\'ve been looking forward to this updated sequel for months. Ordered it, received it, eagerly installed it... all I can say is what a disappointment.The storyline is generic and uninteresting, the interface is cludgy and unintuitive, and there are several things that are just plain annoying. I don\\'t know if I can bring myself to finish this game...Like the original 1988 version of Pool of Radiance, you will waste a lot of time fighting long meaningless battles for little or no experience points.All negative aspects aside, the graphics and animations are great. If you don\\'t care about role-playing and an interesting storyline, and just want to run around spending all of your time fighting for no reason, then this game is for you.\\n__label__1 I Want A Refund!: After the anticipation I felt for this game, all I can feel now is bewilderment. How could this game have been released? I have played for about four hours and have given up. The gameplay is horrible. It is slow, the cursor movement is choppy and at first level my sorcerer has no spells. I am unfamiliar with the 3rd edition rules of D&D, but I always thought a sorcerer would get at least one spell so it must be a game flaw. I have not found one single quality in this game that would make it remotely fun to play.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. You will be better off playing Baldur\\'s gate, BG2 or Icewind dale again. If you are a fan of these games, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed with Pool of Radiance.\\n__label__2 Defending the Game: Ok, so many people ripped apart this game. Personally, I didn\\'t think it was that bad. My game has only crashed once, much less then BG2 when it first came out. It\\'s one of those games that gets really bad if you don\\'t like it.Problems:Long combat (slow game)Little choices (example you can cast level 8 spells but theres only one option for a class)Interface (takes time to figure out what things do)The manual is little helpKnowledge of D&D; is importantNot much of an RPGPositives:Great GraphicsRuns Smoothly (No jerky movements)Cool dungen crawl systemFun combat (Turns allow you to enjoy spells)Turn based system allows you to enjoy combatMany mini quests in a dungenmany itemsOverall I enjoyed the game, then again I got a great deal. It is definatly not worth [the money], but if you find it for a cheap price, I recommend getting it.\\n__label__1 Garbage: What a peace of garbage, won\\'t register, nothing wrong with my internet connection. Won\\'t down load, hours of frustration, took a couple hours off to cool off, try again, then the same old crap. This is going back. Only reason it gets one star is because there\\'s nothing less.\\n__label__2 GREAT BUT DATED 3 DISC SET IS NICE BUT......................: I am a big fan of Disney films. The animated classics will be forever imprinted in my mind. I do have a huge problem with any censorship! Unfortunately, the people at Disney decided to buckle under to it, because of a few cry babies complaining about racial stereotypes in some of their films. I know I am not the first to say this,but really are these people serious? I am Italian and German, do you think I have not seen my share of stereotyping in my 45 years on this planet? Why hasn\\'t Stromboli from Pinochhio been altered for it\\'s depiction of an Italian? It seems we are very selective with what we censor..hhmmm!I don\\'t mind it because I know the characterization is just that and it doesn\\'t reflect the entire race! Please stop censorship of any kind especially regarding these historic works of art. You can not change history you can only learn from it!\\n__label__1 One box was not usable: I purchased the product in February 2012. The product contained three boxes. Two of the three boxes were fine. However, one of the boxes did not have any liquid in it. It had the color base but not the liquid, therefore, I couldn\\'t use it. The cap was tight, it didn\\'t spill, it was never filled because it was completely dry!\\n__label__1 Certainly not worth $10 each: We use 9v rechargable batteries at our church. These will only last 2 hours in a wireless microphone. They will barely last 2 hours in our wireless audio packs (ear buds) and when I use them for my electric bass wireless transmitter device they barely get through 30 minutes of use per charge. Since we have three services and practice that morning as well, these batteries do not cut it.We found these Digimate 280mAh rechargeable 9v\\'s that work much better... we can get two complete weekends from one charge on these... plus, they were only $5 each.\\n__label__2 Like it alot: I really do like the CD. Although it\\'s not my favorite of theirs. It does have alot of good songs on it, I find myself listening to the other CD\\'s more.\\n__label__2 Great Item.: This USB wireless adapter worked and still works like a charm. Installation is a brease and works on every computer and laptop I tried it.Pros:1. Great operation2. Catches excellent signal over long distance due to the external antenna3. Virtually plug and playCons:1. The little prop-up antenna can break easy. The plastic is not too strong2. If you switch USB ports it will ask for the driver again!3. Does not work with Linux, but I did not fight with it too much!\\n__label__1 Not a very good receiver: I have a Netgear MA101 802.11b USB adapter sitting next to the WG121 adapter. The MA101 consistently receives a stronger signal by FAR compared to the WG121. Both adapters are less than 20 feet from the access point. The WG121 cannot sustain a good connection (i.e a relative signal strength of 5-8 on a scale of 10). The MA101 indicates a perfect connection (10 on a scale of 10) ALWAYS. I will put up with the slower speed to get a stable, consistent, strong connection. The WG121 is being returned and I will stick with the MA101 (USB1.1, 802.11b adapter).\\n__label__1 constant lockups: I\\'ve had nothing but trouble with this adapter on my system. My system locks up constantly if it is connected. Apparently, a lot of other people with Athlon systems are having the same problem - so buyer beware.\\n__label__2 A MUST Read, the best: This a a book for all of us that are looking to find God and not sure how to get their. John Eldredge is an author who shares his spiritual heart with your searching heart. I have read 3 of his books, and he is a genuine, spiritual follower of Jesus Christ. He talks to me through his words in a way that I can relate. This is a 6 star book on a scale of 5. Best money you will spend.\\n__label__2 Powerful Application: This book weaves the Gospel message alongside all of the great stories and films over the last fifty years. I found it to be inspirational and even gave a copy to each of my children with a reminder that their lives are part of a bigger story. \"His-Story\" because our personal history really is about God\\'s story for each one of us. It\\'s a quick read, but one you won\\'t forget because of so many powerful life applications.\\n__label__1 it took a heroic effort to finish it...: yeah, so...i did want to see how it turned out but the ending was mostly so @#@# cliche... it\\'s not the increduality of the stripper hooking up with the nerd mortician but just everything else so predictable. there was some potential. but it didn\\'t pan out...about 1/2 way through the film i was tracking how much time was left and using my utmost personal control to not Fast Forward to the end.that movie plot technic, very-loosely-interrelated collage of stories that make up a single film...it\\'s worn thin already. eg, forest whitaker never meets jessica biel in the film but they both related to the mortician at different times--but did the mortician (being the only mortician in the film) get the boys body? the tranny\\'s body?\\n__label__1 Had to return: The dvd was mislabeled with the wrong zone. It was listed as Zone 1 but when I received the dvd it was marked for a different zone that I couldn\\'t play in the USA. I had planned to purchase the same dvd again but the price had more than doubled and tripled. Needless to say, I was very disappointed especially because of the misleading information given on my original purchase. The movie itself is a very good story with excellent acting; humor, romance, and fantasy all rolled into one. The special effects are realistic. I would recommend the movie for anyone who likes fantasy type stories such as Harry Potter or The Lord of The Rings. It is that type of genre and very well done.\\n__label__2 I don\\'t know why I love this movie so much...: It\\'s hilarious, that\\'s why! My friend Kat first introduced me to this movie about a year ago, and now I can\\'t stop watching it! It\\'s got a great storyline and that stupid song will get stuck in your head for weeks! :D (...)\\n__label__1 I don\\'t understand: I honestly don\\'t understand these reviews. I bought this DVD because of a link to the 10th Kingdom. I tried to watch it several times, but could not even get through it once. It is terrible. What were these other reviewers watching?\\n__label__2 Goblets--a great game!: This is a beautiful game that involves lots of strategy. We have one at home and I purchased this one as a gift for my nephews. The price here was great, so we are all happy \"Gobblers\"!\\n__label__2 Terrific game!: I bought Gobblet for my 7 year old, who loves checkers and tic-tac-toe. Not only he loves Gobblet, his dad loves it even more! What a great game for the whole family!\\n__label__1 RIP OFF!: Becareful when you order picture is deceiving. Item sent to me was plastic, colorful colors, and for a very young childs eye. Not for a 12 yr. old. Then when I sent it back only credited alittle over $5.10,I payed alot more. I was not sent the item in the picture. Major disappointment!\\n__label__2 This is a great family game!! Highly recommended!: It\\'s a fun game, and it definitely challenges people of all ages. We love it, and have bought it for many of our extended family members as gifts.\\n__label__2 Fun for the whole family: This game really gets you thinking about strategy. I think it is probably a great way to prepare kids for a game like chess. My husband and I also enjoy playing this game. It is well packaged, not in a cardboard box like most games. The directions are pretty good, although we were confused at first about what kind of movements were allowed, but we seemed to get it all figured out. A very calm, fairly fast game. Would be a great game for much older folks, too.\\n__label__1 Poppin\\' the Hood: I originally heard a cut from this album and thought it would be a great comedy album for my collection. Unfortunately that was the only funny track on this album. It did not measure up to my expectations. Very few tracks are funny and once listened to it is better off filed in the trash.\\n__label__2 Good stuff: I practice kung fu, tai chi, and chi gung. I\\'m not a Reiki practitioner, but the music is soothing for my meditation and tai chi forms. This particular CD is very good. Every song is almost exactly 5 minutes long. The song changes signal when you should switch to the next Reiki position if you are using it but for me it is good for slow chi gung excercises. Still, it\\'s relaxing music for any situation: the car, the office, etc. I listen to it everywhere and suggest you listen to it, too.\\n__label__2 Not a Textbook: This book is not a regular textbook or even a \"non-traditional\" textbook. It really is just what it claims to be and nothing more: 13 tips on how to improve your Japanese. It is fun and helpful, but it\\'s not a book for total beginners. You need to know some Japanese before it can really work for you.I really likeMaking Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don\\'t Tell You, a nice companion to this book. I own both of these, and I think I got more out of \"Making Sense\" actually. Both books are ABOUT learning Japanese; they\\'re not directly teaching you to speak the language. Just keep that in mind when making your purchase decision.\\n__label__2 A super guide to people of all ages!: As an anime lover and general Japanese enthusiast, I think this book is very intelligent and fun to work with. There are only two problems: a) the price b)they dont teach you how to read kanji!\\n__label__1 Music is cooking; sound quality is stone cold: This is a great live album; my only complaint is the sound quality - I have played this disc on a decent system (dedicated CD transport, tube amps, and beyond-modest speakers), and find that instrument separation and sound stage are virtually NON-EXISTENT!! I have played tons of other Miles\\' albums on the same system and most of them sound great - especially the Columbia/Sony releases, remastered or not.I strongly recommend the \"Highlights from Plugged Nickel\" instead, unless you don\\'t mind hearing the great(est) Jazz live performance using one ear.\\n__label__2 AMAZING AND SO MUCH FUN: So much fun i got this for christmas and lately its been \" hey do you want to play hockey? \" it is big and fun and it comes with two goalie sticks (one for each goal) and four sticks ( one for each person ) it is so much fun!!!!\\n__label__2 Goldfinger DVD: well this dvd is jsut awesome and i dont know what that dude is saying that blink fans cant appreaciate this kind of music cuz im a blink fan too and i love goldfinger\\'s music its like totally awesome this dvd is the best! its got tons of like extras and old live shows totally amazing if you are a goldfinger fan you should definatly get it!\\n__label__1 Maybe Chinese Drywall is Easier to Cut: I\\'ve cut narrow strips no problem. No problem, except I have to measure with a tape everytime I change size because the built in rule cuts narrow. I have found anything bigger than 3 inch doesn\\'t cut all the way through. I\\'m cutting 1/2 inch and have the wheels set all the way in. The u shaped piece of metal bends and I have to use a razor. It makes a nice straight line to cut along though. I guess I should have paid 3 times as much for the American stripper.\\n__label__2 Wonderful Performances: I\\'ve been a fan of Ms. Carlson since the mid 70\\'s when she performed locally in rock bands. Her move to jazz standards was the right move (not to knock her ability to rock). This is a wonderful album with strong performances by her and her accompanying musicians. I think it\\'s stronger than her critically acclaimed Christmas albumThis Christmas ... my favorite things. I\\'ve listened to this album literally hundreds of times and it still wears very well.\\n__label__2 Help me, please....: I\\'m frequently up in the middle of the night with one of our two babies, and I just became completely hooked on this show. I DVR all the episodes in case we all happen to be sleeping, and I can\\'t wait to see each new episode. The problem, however, is that it\\'s not listed on the DHLTH channel at all after tomorrow (07/27/07). Mandy Patinkin\\'s character just had his license reinstated after a brief suspension and hearing. He and Diane Venora\\'s character just broke up. What happens next???? Someone help me, please.....\"Chicago Hope-ful\"\\n__label__2 Release them all and I shall buy!: Mandy Patinkins is a very underrated actor: I would love to see him in this show! To see a master like E.G. Marshall in quality television towards the end of his working career would also be truly amazing. Hector Elizondo is always underrated, and I always thought that Adam Arkin was George Clooney... They look the same. I thought Clooney was on Chicago Hope and that was what made him famous. I do think ER is probably one of the finest TV shows ever, so would be curious to see how Hope pans out if it ever comes out. I haven\\'t seen St. Elsewhere yet, and am hesitant to buy the first season the only reason being that if I like it, I would be annoyed if they don\\'t release the following seasons.\\n__label__1 OH !! Where are the lights !!!: DeLonghi DCH1030 Ceramic HeaterDON\"T BUY THIS SPACE HEATER !!! UNLESS, you don\\'t mind partial outages throughout your house. It\\'s just too STRONG and it tripped over and over parts of our home - EEHHHHH EVEN THE TVs and the PC!!! Finally had to call an electricn, and we all know how expensive THEY can be. But, he asked if we had AHY new electirical things in the house. We didn\\'t even THINK of the space heater. The electican just happened to see the space heater on the floor by my PC (COOL AREA< HERE) and immediately picked it up. Sure enough, it was a 1500W. IT WAS THE CULPRIT !! I have run other 1500W space heaters, but there is JUST SOMETHING about this little lemon. Cost us $89 for the electrican (cheap around here). You are warned !!!!\\n__label__1 Don\\'t Be Fooled!: Don\\'t be fooled. This book has a title very similar to The Ultimate Book of Kid Concocitons book I saw on PBS. I bought this book thinking it was the PBS book and was very upset. I\\'m sure I am not the only one making this mistake. The projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years, Buyer beware! I would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book.\\n__label__1 virtual makeover: i got this product with no information and i can see it on my computer but it wont let me add any photos. i was getting it for fun, but it has only been frusterating.\\n__label__1 When GOD doesn\\'t heal???: When God doesn\\'t heal?? Let\\'s ask Jesus (the One who bore ALL of our sicknesses and pains) about that one.It\\'s not God who doesn\\'t heal us, it\\'s us who don\\'t receive the healing that He already provided through the cross of Christ and by His grace.What a completely disrespectful thing to say about God!\"When God doesn\\'t heal\"...another lie of religion.\\n__label__1 very unhappy: I expected to recieve a book, not a small pamphlet for $128.00. I had the great grace to have Msgr. Turro as an instructor in seminary and seek anything he has written; but not 24 pages for $128.00!! When contacting the seller, and Amazon to return it, I have not had any response. This is the first time I have ever had any problems returning anything with Amazon. I caution anyone using this seller.\\n__label__2 an unknown gift...: I\\'m not really into this kind of music, but this harp music is very elusive and well crafted. The pieces sing to you and take you on a journey.\\n__label__2 As always, amazing music: I love this album. Several of the songs were remixes or new approaches to ones I already know and love, while the rest were completely new to me. However, as a big fan of Des\\'ree, the new songs do not disappoint. A great album, even though it only plays on a few of my CD players!\\n__label__2 Art is eternal: The combination of Miles Davis and Gil Evans is unequaled. The music they and gifted sidemen created is timeless and brilliant. And it swings, rocks, grooves, and kills even after over 50 years.\\n__label__2 Awesome Grip!!: This is such an awesome grip. It made my 15 years old Ruger P89 looks brand new! Not only it looks great, but it fits great. It also feels better shooting my P89 for sure. I highly recommend this grip on your Ruger P series.\\n__label__2 Great on my Ruger P89: The only reason I\\'m not giving this 5 stars is because it arrived over a week late. Aside from that, I love it. It\\'s easy to install (just remove the two screws and pop it on). It fits great and looks good too. Most importantly, it fits PERFECTLY in my hand. I absolutely love it.\\n__label__2 Great Product for everyone: So I bought this funny looking saddle because I had cyst on my lady parts and could no longer use a regular bike seat. No fun. This bike seat took all the pressure off said \"sensitive bits\" and is actually more comfortable in general than \"normal\" bike seats, medical problems or not. I have ridden it for about 6 months now and taken the bike out on a 5 hour trip, as well as short term city biking. Over all it is of excellent quality. Yes there are some problems with this seat. you loose the ability to steer with your legs, and on long bike rides your thighs will be a bit sore. BUT you will be less sore than you would have been on a regular seat. and your sensitive areas will be just fine.Over all I highly recommend this seat for all.\\n__label__1 It was not what i expected!!!: THE BOOK \"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE\" WRITTEN BY JENNY K. WAS AS MANY PEOPLE WROTE IN THEIR REVIEWS, \"AN INSULT TO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE,\"BUT THE ONE WRITTEN BY NICHOLAS SPARKS HAPPENS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TOUCH TO IT, MAKING READERS ALL OVER THE WORLD SAVOR THE STORY. I HAVE READ \"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE\" BY SPARKS ABOUT 6 TIMES BECAUSE I LOVED IT THE FIRST TIME AND HAD ME CRAVING FOR IT 5 MORE TIMES. BUT LETS BE NICE AND AT LEAST GIVE JENNY K THE CREDIT FOR WRITING IT...\\n__label__1 Nothing New here: Seems like the message of this documentary could be delivered in 10 minutes. Every thing needs to be made into an 1.5 hours, just get to the point.\\n__label__2 Ingredients: Knocked my socks off. This is absoluty a must see if you wonder about why they re putting aresnic on meat at grocery stores, why we have flourine - absolutly toxic mass-scale industrial waste from the fertilizer industry - in our water supply, or why genetically modified seeds are grown into obscenely larger plants and then sprayed with toxic weed killer on a weekly basis, for months upon months. -Round up- -In your food that you eat- Think about it.\\n__label__2 Essentials of Sociology - great book!: The book is written very well and is filled with tons of information! The numerous real world stories within each chapter help readers see the concepts in sociology the textbook introduces applied to the real world, and the stories are incredibly interesting. Recommended for anyone who is interested in studying sociology.\\n__label__1 I really struggled with the heroine: I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I\\'m still irritated by the h\\'s attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h\\'s attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how \\'different\\' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H\\'s love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving.I bought the trilogy, which I\\'ve put aside for now because I was so put off by Violet. I do like the author though and enjoyed The Temptation trilogy so I\\'ll probably pick up the second book at a later date.\\n__label__1 Lamplight 52664 Farmers Lantern: This lamp really was not what I thought it was suppose to be.It has to use oil. I wanted battery.\\n__label__1 Typical of the Series: One of the problems with Enterprise is the accusation it ignores establised canon. The premise of this story: if Vulcans kill does it betray the teachings of Surak has already been addressed in The Original Series by Spock.\\n__label__2 great gift..: I loved everything about this ring..unique design, comfortable, nice weight. I received it on X-mas eve and wasn\\'t expecting to receive it in time for the holiday..bonus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sizing, it runs a little large. My overall experience with this company was excellent.\\n__label__1 Cracks Under Pressure: It\\'s unfortunate that a PDA with so much promise is built so poorly. The case chips easily, and the surface you write on cracks very easily. I\\'ve already had to replace one to the tune of $80. If you plan on using your PDA as a truly portable computer, on that will be with you on the road, I\\'d highly recommend you look at other options, like the Palm Pilot, Compaq IPAQ or the Hewlett Packard Vornada, all sturdier offerings. The Handspring cracks under even the slightest pressure.\\n__label__2 Absolutely brilliant!!!!!!!: I have been a fan of No Doubt for about 8 years now, and this is just a little something to show how much they have achieved.The singles album is something everyone should own, track to track it is pure genius, from upbeat rocky classics that instantly put you in a good mood to slower beats such as running, that just make you smile and relax you.Then the everything in time album, is just as good it contains rare songs and remixes, and they all hold a unique catchiness.However the dvd\\'s really top off this package, the videos dvd is pure genius the videos are amazing to watch, and the live in the tragic kingdom just gives you an example of how cool they are live.If you are a no doubt fan, you must own this. Enjoy :)\\n__label__2 Worth the price of admission just for Cleese\\'s eulogy to Graham Chapman!!: I loved this set. Things I\\'d never seen, dirt about the filming of Holy Grail, Brian, & Meaning Of Life. Cleese in a dirndl was quite fetching, & his eulogy of Graham Chapman was almost worth the price of admission. Too bad there were no llamas, & no small marsupials ate the delicious eucalyptus leaves, yum, yum. G\\'day, Bruce!\\n__label__2 Happy rats: There are far less things in this product my rats wont eat. It\\'s hard to find rat food that isnt all seed which they wont touch. They like most of what is in this.\\n__label__2 A book that won\\'t dissapoint you.: Awesome book! I learned more about the Holy Spirit and how He affects my life daily than I have learned in the 30+ years of walking as a Christian. I was in two Bible study settings for the study of this book and each one saw something new and exciting about the Holy spirit and His presence in our lives today. I highly recommend this book.\\n__label__1 UMAX Astra 6450 vs. Microsoft XP Home: Purchased 6450 in June, tested briefly with Microsoft ME. Upgraded to XP Home in January but during installation discovered products are not compatible. I get no help or encouragement from either UMAX or Miscrosoft.\\n__label__2 End of the story...: I absolutely love this book. I originally found this book at a library, borrowed it, renewed it at least 4 times, and I bought it so I CAN KEEP IT FOREVER.Amazing book, it\\'s like Playboy magazine or food network magazine for me.. makes my eyes delighted (:\\n__label__2 Beautiful pictures: but not a book to learn about goldfish. A nice gift book for someone who has goldfish though.\\n__label__1 The lion terrified my son!!: My son is a huge fan of \"Hide and Seek Elmer\". I bought \"Elmer\\'s Friends\" thinking he would love this as well. There is a lion in this book that has the most frightening face. My son would start to cry the page before in anticipation of the upcoming lion. I tore that page out of the book and now my child can enjoy this book again. The other animals are fun, but the lion is terrifying!\\n__label__1 Good Information, Poor Quality: Just received this book after waiting 2 months for it. I purchased it because it is often referenced in other CM books.After just scanning through the book, I can tell that it contains some valuable information. One big minus is the index consists of blank pages, which is really bad for a technical book.The physical quality of the book is very poor. Cheap binding, cheap paper, cheap type. Except for the nice cover, it looks like it was thrown together at Kinkos.What really irks me is that I paid almost $50 for this book. This is something I would pay $10 for a PDF download.\\n__label__2 Would I Measure Up?: This movie had haunted me ever since I first saw it on Los Angeles TV when I was twelve years old. Being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day I would serve in the Army. I always wondered whether I would measure up and be able to lead men in combat.In 1991 I found myself leading a team of American soldiers advising an army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency. Leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended, I felt no different then how Richard Basehart\\'s character did at the end of this movie.Though a bit dated, this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper.\\n__label__1 A dissappointment!: Frankly I\\'m quite dissapointed in this film. It\\'s in black and white, which actually is no problem for me since I enjoy classic war films. The dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio!!! and a very small studio! Really dissapointed. Also nothing really special about the story.\\n__label__1 Korean war movie: In my opinion this was a terrible movie. It deals with a corporal (Richard Basehart) who has leadership issues, i.e. will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation. A better movie would be \"Hell is for Heroes\" which also deals with the Korean war, or \"Retreat Hell\" starring Frank Lovejoy. Don\\'t waste your money or time on this one.\\n__label__2 i think this is a very good Cd: the only thing wrong with this Cd is that they have to many skits. they need to cut down on them\\n__label__1 wooooo: THis album is so Kool-aid pumping sweeeeet it gave me a cavity. RedMans heart pumps Kool-aid on this joint. Its tired....Burn it... Give me MC EIHT.\\n__label__1 Oh man, what a waste of a good Godzilla title!!!: Godzilla\\'s Revenge, what comes to mind when you think of that. I thought Godzilla becomes evil and devastates Tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie. This is all in a boy\\'s dream...what the heck? Now I enjoy Godzilla movies,I even liked Son of Godzilla but this movie is a disgrace. Why would Minilla be Barney and talk? What\\'s with this bully nonsense? I wanted rubber monsters action, the only good point of this movie is Godzilla verses Gabara that\\'s the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage.\\n__label__1 Oh The Pain!!!!!! Have Mercy!!!!!: Oh my gosh!!!! I have now seen how bad a movie can get! I mean, where\\'s the \"Revenge\" here people?! What was Toho thinking? Minilla talks????? This movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy\\'s head. If you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it. Now, if you\\'re looking for the closest thing to Tellatubbies (besides Barney) this is definetly what you\\'re looking for. This is not a Godzilla movie in the slightest.\\n__label__1 Godzilla as, Barney?: Well, almost. This movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences. Most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films, the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual. There are two reasons to get this movie. One, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series, this is a good way to do it. This is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the Godzilla series. The other reason? If your a collector or completionist, buy the video, watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf. Every self proclaimed Godzilla fan should have to watch this video once. It reminds us that Godzilla is for all ages. And it shows that maybe the American Godzilla wasn\\'t that bad. After all, it could have been based on this.\\n__label__2 A Stunning SciFi Action Novel !!!!!: Rarely does a book come my way that I actually cant wait to see the outcome of. Crossworld is one of those rare and compelling stories that anybody with an open mind will enjoy.The story itself is top notch with hints of The Matrix and Blade scattered throughout. Robert Aldrich continually keeps things at a fast and enjoyable pace without sacrificing genious storytelling and immersive detail. Just wait until you witness the awesome hardcore action sequences which are beautifully crafted in every chapter.I fully recommend this adventure tale to anyone with a love of science fiction, anime, fantasy, and breathtaking action. I am eagerly awaiting the following volumes.\\n__label__2 Keep out a picker, but not a kicker: We still use these around the house at all entrance doors. They grasp under the door knob and plant a rubber footer on the floor. If the floor is smooth, like tile or vinyl, the footer and the floor need to be kept clean; otherwise it can slip when forced. I tried getting in once while the thing was in place and I could not do it until I really forced it for a while. I\\'m a big guy, but I think anyone could get past it if they were determined. Therefore, we use it as a way to keep lock pickers out, and we don\\'t expect it to prevent someone from kicking in the door. There are other devices for that purpose, for people who live in those areas where burglaries are committed by serious career criminals. The only thing we get around here might be the wayward teen who might take something if it\\'s easy. So, I cannot give it 5 stars; it will not keep out someone who is determined to get in. Otherwise, it is sturdy and easy to use.\\n__label__1 False sense of security: I bought this item because I am a stay at home mom with a hand disability. We live in a rental apartment and I am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving. First off, it is very sturdy \"looking\" but my 1 year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort. My husband was also able to \"break into\" the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device. It is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn\\'t really help prevent a break in, but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder.\\n__label__2 Great Security for the Price: Definitely a good buy. I use it for my front door, and it doesn\\'t slip or budge an inch when someone tries to open the door. I feel much more secure since I live alone in an apartment. I\\'ve recommended it to friends and family who are pleased with their purchase as well.\\n__label__1 Nothing to Compare to Other Pinball Game: This game is...well just another video game. Nothing like a real pinball game and im sorry but some people that wrote review on this game should try some real paintball simulator like platinum pinball. I would pay about a dollard for this game...maybe less\\n__label__1 This is a 2lb hammer - NOT 7lb as the title states!: Title says it all. Somebody doing data entry messed this one up... It\\'s a 2lb dead-blow hammer, not a 7 lb as the title and description claims. (You can google the model number, or zoom in on the picture to verify - the label on the handle says 2lb.) Returned for a prompt refund.\\n__label__2 Pretty Cool, but not The Whole Way: This movie ROCKS!! My aunt bought me this and I\\'ve loved it!She knows I like Sonic. I gave it a 4 outta 5 \\'cuase of Sonic\\'s voice acting. At the beginning, he sounds relaxed and all cool. But in the middle of the movie, he sounds like an Englishman! What\\'s up with that? And also, it\\'s too dang short! I just want to see more after it\\'s over! One pro is that catchy, \"Look Alike\" tune at the end. They should release that song as a single sooner or later. Anyway, it\\'s a great movie and any sonic fan should get it. P.S. Who\\'s cooler than Tails?!\\n__label__1 this movie sucked: i have seen many sonic cartoons over the years and this movie was the worst. the animation was crappy and the character voices cracked. over all it was a bad movie i wouldnt recamend it at all\\n__label__1 Very disappointed with the Prism: I purchased a Visor Prism as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, I installed the hardware and software exactly as instructed in the manual. The Visor would perform a hot sync, but would not install any applications. After nearly a dozen phone calls to Handspring\\'s technical support, they were still unable to correct the problem, despite the fact that this case was \"escalated\" three times by Handspring\\'s technical support department.This entire fiasco has taken close to a month. I don\\'t anticipate buying any additional products from Handspring. I suggest going with a Palm...it\\'s more reliable.\\n__label__1 handspring prism: the product worked, but the batteries are no good, in only a day the batteries drain and the memory is lost! other than that i received everything i was promised!\\n__label__1 To bulky.: I am going to keep my review short and to the point. Like the palm IIC this portable won\\'t fit in you pocket. Its to bulky. You would be better buying a sony CLIE, or palm 505 before investing your money in the prism.\\n__label__1 Wheeler is no Netter!: This book is wordy and lacks organization. It is full of awkward sentences, rambling paragraphs and has no sense of continuity. The diagrams are not labeled, of low quality and seemingly outdated. There are much better anatomy references out there and I suggest looking into the other literature. Wheeler\\'s text simply demonstrates the need for a Frank Netter of sorts- someone who can do for Oral Anatomy what Dr. Netter did for Gross Anatomy. I\\'m actually considering writing my own text one day so that future students will be able to spend more time focusing on anatomy rather than the minutia and distractions that this book is full of. If you need to learn Oral Anatomy this is not the book that will help.\\n__label__2 Hoyle Board Games has turned the family into addicts!: Hoyle Board games 2001 is a fabulous collection of thoroughly enjoyable and addicting family board games. These great games include beautiful graphic versions of Backgammon, Mancala, Chinese Checkers, Chess, Dominoes, Pachisi, Mah Jong Tiles and the addicting Mah Jong Gravity. Also, there are great versions of Battle Ships, Master Mind, Connect Four, Yahtzee and Chutes and Ladders--all disquised by easily identified title variations. A fun game called Placer Racer is a family favorite. It isn\\'t really a board game - more of an arcade game--shooting colored balls trying to make matches of three while you race against a steadily decreasing game area. This collection of board games is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants fun, wholesome, clean fun for the family.\\n__label__2 All in one: I couldn\\'t believe that there was a box set of this series. It is a must have for thoes who have dabbled in the Method workouts. Each of these workouts flow with one another and having the box set means less money and you can follow through with the total workout. I love this series because they are a are fun to do, combining dance, yoga, weights, and Pilates to give you a challenging full body workout that doesn\\'t stress out your body. These tapes are set up so that if you don\\'t have a lot of time to workout, you can just do one section and you will still sweat. You can also mix and match certian routines to keep your workout interesting. I would recomend these tapes for anyone who is tired of repitition workouts and who are ready to have fun and be creative while sweating away.\\n__label__1 Life Source UB-512 Advanced Memory Wrist Auro: Totaly inadequate. I take the blood pressure following directions and I get 3 different readings . I have been a nurse for over 50 years, and I can\\'t use.\\n__label__2 So far so good - nice product: Received item quickly, well packaged. Popped batteries in and went to town. Works very well. Adaptable to various size wrists.\\n__label__2 Beautiful bed!: This bed is good quality. The matress pad, blanket and pillow are cute and perfect for this bed. My girls use it and love it. The doll is so real and sweet its great to have a nice place to put her. Its easy to put together and can be taken a part easily for storage. I think this is the second thing to get after buying Annabell.\\n__label__1 macross 2 the movie: this movie blows! i wasted my money on this one. i watched it and the whole plot just sucks. why would i watch a movie where the main weapon is a song. Do not waste your time with this one.\\n__label__2 It has ON/OFF switch: ON/Off switch was the reason why I picked this light.9 out of 10 similar lights don\\'t have it and without ityou have to unplug it from USB just to turn it off.Works great for my needs, fair quality. Buy it.\\n__label__1 what you want is the fourth edition: I\\'m sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition. There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002.\\n__label__1 good illustrations, bad writing: I don\\'t understand any of these other reviewers. The book has lots of colorful illustrations, and the thickness make the book look comprehensive, but the writing seems to need more organization. Surely it could have been written more concisely. Incredibly boring to read through.\\n__label__1 Disapointing: Your editorial review is correct but understates the technical problem with the sound in this whole series. The excess reverberation, poor audio production, and the English accents make this almost indecipherable by North Americans. I get the feeling that the director is very visually oriented, but he tries to get cute and technical. The trick shots are just too contrived. The cast does not seem to be having any fun, the hallmark of a good G&S performance. They are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique.I far prefer the series done at Stratford in Canada rather than this candidate for Madame Tusaud\\'s museum.\\n__label__2 tasty recipes with few ingredients: I\\'ve used this cookbook several times and every dish I\\'ve made has come out great. The thing I like best is that most of the recipes have relatively few ingredients and simple steps. I have several crockpot cookbooks and I\\'ve found this one to be the best.\\n__label__1 rather disapointing: This collection would be fun if all the games could be played head to head online, but they can\\'t. The pool game is fun but you are much better off buying Sierra\\'s Maximum Pool instead.\\n__label__1 Bad analog recording, Background noise for digital music: I purchased this product mainly for recording my LP collection into digitial format using my laptop. I thought that this could be a good product for that purpose, until I used it. This product could not record properly from analog input. It\\'s even much much worse than recording using laptop\\'s analog input. Not only the recording level was so low, but also the recorded mp3 or wma had so much artificial noise that it was unusable. I used USB2 connection all the time. It seems to me that USB2 doesn\\'t help any better.Playing digital music was relatively OK, except that it produced slight background white noise. Still directly connecting from my laptop to the speaker produced much better result.I wonder what the purpose of this device might be ?Not recommended.\\n__label__1 berlitz employees write these reviews: berlitz employees write most of the gushing reviews posted on this site. Beware that there are much less expensive products, that there is nothing revolutionary about these products, and that you will find less expensive variants elsewhere. Be cost conscious and know that you will not learn a language from a cd rom\\n__label__2 Dale Bruning.... smooooth.....: I once read, in the liner notes of an Ed Bickert album, about how refreshing it is to hear jazz that is \"quiet and pretty\". Such is the case here. No pyrotechnic chops or blistering arpeggios. Just simple, good, tasty jazz lines. Moore and Bruning blend together perfectly, as they have done before. If you\\'re into the likes of Jim Hall, Ed Bickert, or Royce Campbell, you can\\'t go wrong with this CD.\\n__label__1 Beware it is a single: I purchased this CD for 11.99 not realizing that it was a single. It may have been labeled, but at that price who would think it was a single. It is now selling for about 1/3 of that price which is much more reasonable. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t realize this until after I opened it. It was very disappointing to say the least.\\n__label__2 post-war germany and it\\'s past haunting it. rating: 7: Frank Defelitta wrote a good story on a holocaust survivor/mental patient on a killing spree to advenge the wrongs of the past. it has a good storyline and takes you into 1960\\'s germany and Israel and you get a feeling of the time. The relationship between the detective and female holocaust survivor leaves the reader confused and disappointed. I still pull my copy out & read it every few years.\\n__label__2 Love the Balance Buddy!: Best money ever spent! We tried for a day or two the old fashioned way with me holding the back of the seat and had the worst time. When we used the balance buddy my daughter learned in 2 days! No bending over for me and she was so much more stable.\\n__label__1 Strike Out: Mr. Woodcock had such great potential but failed to deliver. There are some real heavy hitters in the cast.Billy Bob Thornton has the capacity to make any film a classic when directed properly. Although, he had his moments in this one.Susan Sarandon was probably not right for the part...OR...was right for the part if the film was executed correctly. She is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable. This role was beneath her to say the least.Seann William Scott is a modern comedy genuis. He has the look, the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level. He was also probably not right for this role. He belongs in Hollywood blockbusters, not forgettable films like Mr. Woodcock.Three terrific actors combined into one film should have been a winner but just couldn\\'t do it. Three strikes.\\n__label__1 Abysmal: Sean William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon are capable, if not excellent, actors. In fact, I\\'m certain that if anyone with lesser Hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made.Other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor Ethan Supplee, there was nothing to laugh at. It\\'s \"Bad Santa\" Thornton watered down to the least, while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland, in a movie so predictable that I have a hard time believing it was even written.Here\\'s the deal: Small town boy makes good, goes home for accolades, meets mothers new boyfriend, hates mothers new boyfriend, decides he\\'s being selfish and works to get them back together.I don\\'t recommend buying it, I don\\'t recommend renting it. If you\\'re bedridden when it comes on TBS at 8am and the batteries in your remote are dead, that should be your only excuse for watching it.\\n__label__1 Mr. Woodcock is no Bad Santa!: Mr. Woodcock was quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Seann William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon, among others.A best-selling author returns home to pick up a prestigious local award only to find his mom dating his high school gym teacher that used to terrorize him and shatter his self esteem. Things quickly become more complicated when the hazing starts anew as the gym teacher picks up where he left off...In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it\\'s a mediocre movie and that\\'s about it; no masterpiece here... 2.4 Stars\\n__label__1 What kind of humour do you like?: If you are the type to laugh if another person gets a ball in their privates, you may like this movie.After Scott\\'s 20th humiliation I couldn\\'t bare seeing more. I was expecting some equal kind of comic battle between the two characters (like Scott getting equal with Thornton - doesn\\'t happen), instead Scott is humiliated throughout the movie. Also that the unsympathetic character played by Thornton always comes out as the smug one is very disturbing.\\n__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!: DO NOT BUY THIS TV! I BOUGHT THIS MODEL SIX MONTHS AGO, AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE REPAIR SHOP FOR FOUR OUT OF THE SIX MONTHS!! THE LIGHT ENGINE HAS BURNED OUT TWICE, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE/SUPPORT AT RCA IS ATROCIOUS!! ANY TIME YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT OVER AN HOUR TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN\\'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THE STATUS OF YOUR REPAIR OR WHEN PARTS MIGHT ARRIVE AT YOUR LOCAL REPAIR SHOP.IN FACT, AFTER DEALING WITH RCA\\'S CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER, I WOULD RECOMMEND NEVER TO BUY RCA PERIOD. THEY REFUSE TO DO ANY EXCHANGES THROUGH ANY OF THEIR DEALERS, AND THEY HAVE PROMISED TWICE TO EXCHANGE DIRECT FROM THE WAREHOUSE, ONLY TO GO BACK ON THEIR PROMISE TO SAY THEY\\'VE \"FOUND THE PART I NEED\", ONLY TO SHIP THE WRONG PART TO THE LOCAL REPAIR CENTER, AND THEN MAKE EXCUSES AND SAY ANOTHER ONE IS ON THE WAY. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE NOW, AND MY TV IS STILL BEING REPAIRED WITH NO END IN SIGHT. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!!\\n__label__2 The Beatles\\' Long & Winding Road: As a hard-core, inveterate Beatles\\' fan, I loved this collection. It is true that the narrator has the enthusiasm of a dead horse, but don\\'t let that stop you from enjoying this collection.Viewers will be treated to some bonus footage of the Beatles in newsclips and interviews. No songs are included in this collection. It is power-packed with information and, if you can overlook the tiring drone of the narrator you will certainly have much to cheer about this collection.For those who are determined to travel down the Long & Winding Road from start to finish (although you may want to watch this in installments), you will get a lot of good Beatle exposure and information as the boys shot to fame in Liverpool, to their famous August 29, 1966 swan song concert in San Francisco.\\n__label__1 Very bad film, do not waste your time: This film had poor video quality, horrible acting, an extremely weak story-line and it was directed poorly. I understand that independent films do not have the budget or production values of industry-funded movies, but even by indie film standards - this movie was horrible. I regret spending $1.99 to watch this. Even at an amateur level, the videography and acting are below standard. The scenes are so badly done that I found myself chuckling during serious scenes. I would not recommend that anyone watch this film.\\n__label__2 A bit pricey but cute: You can find cheaper hats at Target....but this hat is cute cute cute. If you have the extra cash lying around. Downside: it doesn\\'t have a strap to keep it attached to the baby.\\n__label__2 Adorable.: I bought this hat for my 3 month old who was quickly outgrowing all of his infant hats. Not only is this one cute and well made, it stays on his noggin. Other hats seem to work their way off during the course of the day, or migrate forward and cover his eyes. The material is soft and cozy, and we love that it isn\\'t made in China.\\n__label__2 I LOVE THIS HAT!!!: This hat didn\\'t fit my son until he was 3 months (75% for head size) He looks like a real stud in it and gets nothing but compliments. I love the color it goes well with many of his outfits. He is now 5 months (still 75%) and the hat is getting tight and short. Other have mentioned folding the rim down to make it fit longer... I think this makes the hat look weird and disproportioned. I do wish the ears were more forward; the ears are centered on the hat, so when wearing it they are back by the crown of his head. it would look cuter to have them more towards his temples to so could see them when looking directly at him. Though you can still see them I think this would improve the look. Overall great product!\\n__label__2 Amazing: Charlie Christian is Incredible.this is Why History is so Important to Go&Discover a Great Talent such as This Man.He will Blow your Mind along the Lines of Robert Johnson.\\n__label__2 Terrific First Novel: Keith Scribner has written both a psychological drama and a suspense thriller in his first novel. The Goodlife, based on an actual event, begins with the kidnapping of a chemical company executive and follows the crime over a three day period. The plot unfolds through the points of view of the five main characters, moving the story forward, from different directions, to it\\'s completion. This is a very complex, yet readable, compelling story. The writing is gritty, riveting and true to life and Mr. Scribner has a real talent for dialogue. The characters are painstakingly drawn and developed and the scenes so vivid they almost jump off the page. A tight, suspenseful, fast-paced page turner. Keith Scribner doesn\\'t disappoint.\\n__label__1 Pretty pictures, poor directions: Despite the very nice photos by Mr. Brooks and Mr. Cook, some of the directions can be a bit misleading. After following the directions from this book to Kings Creek Falls, I became considerably disoriented and only found the falls after consulting with other directions from online sources. Mark Morrison\\'s Carolina guide has much better directions, though less photographs. Online researching will also provide many, many more than the 27 Falls located in \"The Waterfalls of South Carolina.\" Check on Allen Easler\\'s website or the Greenville Online Outdoors for more falls and, hopefully, better directions. If you just want to look at the pictures, though, this is a nice little paperback.\\n__label__2 Great Value; Easy To Use: I purchased this scanner for the sole purpose of transferring old slides to a digital format. After more than a hundred scans, I have to say this is a wonderful item. It is easy to use; the software is simple. Though I have no comparison scans, the image resolution exceeds expectations (I scanned them at 1600 x 1200).A professional photographer might prefer a better model, but for home scanning and transferring personal pictures, the Canon 4400F is a great value!My family and I enjoyed seeing full-sized pictures for the first time in decades.\\n__label__2 Worth it for home use: I recently purchased a new computer that came with, of course, windows vista. Unfortunately, my old canoscan 1220 scanner was not compatible with this operating system so I started looking for a new one. I really liked the old one so I stuck with Canon and got the 4400. It\\'s faster than the 1220, but is a bit bulkier, and requires its own power outlet (the 1220 was powered thru the USB). Good scanner, but if I could have kept my 1220 I would have.\\n__label__2 Canon scanner: For the money, it seems to do a very good job on photo reproduction as well as text. A bit noisy, but easy to operate.\\n__label__2 Great Scanner: This scanner for the price is great. It does exactly what I need for my type of work.This is the second Cannon product I have owned. Was not happy with my HP maybe it\\'s time to change?\\n__label__2 Great little scanner: This is a nice little scanner. It is small, scans nicely, easy to install and use... I have Vista, and it wasn\\'t really any problem to install the software. i can\\'t speak about the software b/c I don\\'t use it much (I import into Photoshop), but it looks pretty simple to use. The push buttons are a breeze to use. I use this for my small business as my primary scanner and it works nicely. Good value overall...\\n__label__2 Canon Scanner: Good scanner with excellent resolution. Software is not \"user friendly\"; too complex. Top of unit is curved and if desk space is an issue, it wont support any thing on top of the unit. Negative and slide scanning a plus.\\n__label__1 Canon CanoScan 4400fFColor Image Scanner (1306B002): I\\'m a little disappointed in the Canon Scanner because I thought the advance in tecnoledge would have produced a better, more advance product. The white cover used to scan photos is a flimsy piece of cardboard, which Im sure will bend,ware out, or crease some place. More frustrating is trying to put the flimsy piece back on.\\n__label__2 Great: Everything as promised. Really easy to operate, great quality of documents and pictures after scanning. The scanner itself is very light and not bulky at all.\\n__label__2 Does what\\'s supposed to do, well: The results of the scans for all media (negatives, slides, photos, paper) are very good. The software user interface is a bit clumsy, though. I\\'m sure Canon can afford to spend a bit more to get software to match the hardware.\\n__label__1 This tv is terrible: The dvd player hasn\\'t worked since the first 2 months I had it. It constantly has to be unplugged and reset due to blue screen.\\n__label__1 Extremely bad: Please do not buy this video. It contains a very bad quality course of japanese including poor and old images. Japanese simbols on screen are almost impossible to read. If you buy it, you will loose your money.\\n__label__1 Returned twice: Ordered 4 chairs...sat on them once...and 2 broke immediately. They were replaced and I am softly sitting on them and not letting anyone over aprox. 100 lbs or so to sit on them. If another breaks I will try to return them all for a refund.\\n__label__2 Completely engaging, original, pull-you-along fiction.: I can\\'t believe I let this book sit in my \"to be read\" pile for two years. I was sucked into the story right away. I don\\'t know anything about painting or the Dutch, but this book is fantastic! Very funny and wonderfully detailed. I am SO intrigued by the author\\'s mixing of fact and fiction. Time to do some sleuthing of my own on the internet...\\n__label__2 Used but functional.: I purchased a used Dual XDM7510 In Dash CD/MP3/WMA Receiver from Crader Electronics & p.c. repair. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it took a bit longer to arrive than the estimated shipping date and all the old solder-less crimp style connectors were left on. I purchased this specific unit to replace the same style unit that quit working and the used one works just fine after installation. It arrived clean and in good shape.\\n__label__2 FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: We use ours very heavily!!!!! Ours is used for our Ebay sales, and sometimes is on and being used all day long. It is one incredible machine!!!!Far better than it\\'s same priced competitors, it comes with incredible software from Newsoft Vista Scan with the scanner interface of Presto Image Folio. It is the simplest and best scanner software I have seen. It eliminates the 47 steps that is associated with Adobe software.Buy it now!!!!!John\\n__label__2 A great idea, wonderfully executed.: I bought this album being a huge Metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations. To be very honest, I was expecting something a little bit different, more in line with the stuff that Metheny plays with his group and so it took me a little time to appreciate its true beauty. But, over the last 2 weeks, the album has really grown on me. \"Nascente\" and \"Sometimes I See\" are just superb, wonderfully arranged, and with great solos. Metheny\\'s note choice, on the whole, is exquisite as usual and so is Brecker\\'s and Hancock\\'s. James Taylor also sings wonderfully on his two appearances lending a distinct charm to the album. I would highly recommend this work to everyone.\\n__label__2 Lullaby: I put this CD on one evening and lay down to listen. Between sleep and awake, it played while the curtains billowed as an ocean breeze came through the window. It was perfect.That memory will always define my assessment of this CD-a great lullaby.\\n__label__1 Skip the beauty, give me pretty: There is SO much potential in the lineup of this CD: the singular talents of the instrumentalists, the subtle and complex simplicity of the tunes, the proven chemistry of the musicians- well documented from numerous beautiful collaborations past, the history alone that these artists have been steeped in; but pretty is the password of the day here.Romantic sounds for a candlelit dinner. Numerous candidates for any \"best makeout tunes of all time\" compilations. Even James Taylor\\'s blessings to validate the safety factor of this project. Nearness of You has all this, and less.Missing are fresh meaningful readings of the (beautiful) compositions, any hint of lyric urgency or that sense of voice that makes a jazz ballad sing. Now I know that Michael, Pat, Herbie, Charlie and Jack have paid their dues and have proven they\\'re beautiful artists. Just don\\'t look to The Ballad Book as evidence. You should buy this knowing the music is pretty and money is beautiful.\\n__label__1 don\\'t waste your money: do not waste your money on this. it has the graphics of a gameboy advance. buy a real game like halo or jedi academy\\n__label__2 Love in the Midst of War.: I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased every book that I could find written by the author; this is one of my favorite books by the author. The book has an extremely well written storyline and I greatly enjoyed reading about the interaction between each of the major and minor characters. I have never enjoyed reading about the American Civil War, however, the author was able to capture my attention in this book. I highly recommend this novel; even-though it is a fictional account of the American Civil War, it is an exceptional account of the interaction between two men from opposite sides finding happiness together.\\n__label__1 Total Rubbish: I should have known better. Although it\\'s said you can\\'t tell a book by its cover...in the case of \"The Low Road\", I should have trusted my better instincts. The cover is a dead give-away. I love period fiction and I enjoy gay literature, but this book is neither. It\\'s nothing more than the gay equivalent of a smutty bodice ripper -- all longing and panting. It was all I could do to get through the first chapter before tossing this ridiculous book into the recycle bin.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t waste your money here: This book is proof positive that the English are not entrepreneurs. The book is very short with large typeset and poorly drawn illustrations conveying next to nothing.\\n__label__2 GPS Software: It shipped quickly and got there when expected. The problem is that the softwares manual is not very user friendly and can be confusing for 1st time users.\\n__label__1 Are you kidding me?: I honestly do not know what Topo US is good for. I have hunted for hiking trails but haven\\'t found any in my area... or any area for that matter. I have found pipelines and powerlines... whooptie do...Also, I use my Garmin for road navigation... I assumed that TOPO would overlay street maps... WRONG... There are like a million little TOPO maps and I have to go into map setup and individually enable/disable the maps... a major pain when scrolling through 50-200 maps. The TOPO has streets but then are WAY out of date. like 20 years out of date. and you HAVE to look at the old roads when looking at TOPO data.Some friends had me do some searches on underwater wrecks for deep sea diving but they didn\\'t come up... I honestly don\\'t know what this software is good for.2 Stars instead of one because there ARE topolines and mountian peaks.\\n__label__2 Terrific young adult book: Under a Bear Moon is a wonderful paranormal tale. On first glance you might expect a wearbear story to be all gruesome and blood and guts, but nothing could be further from the truth with this book. Carrie Masek has put together a sweet love story between two teenagers, one of whom has a bit of a problem with being out after dark. The story is well-crafted, showing the blossoming love between Greg and Lynda as well as the difficulties of falling in love with someone who is ...well, different. I recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys romance, and especially as a gift to a teenage girl.\\n__label__1 another great Serie from the 80s: This is another great series from the 80s but its a BIG BIG BIG shame that Warner Brothers cancled again a DVD release. And I don\\'t understand it. I really would love to buy the whole serie on DVD.Sadly I\\'m from Switzerland and can\\'t watching it online through amazon-video.Common WB, give us Fan\\'s a chance!!!!!\\n__label__2 please hurry up: It\\'s half way through 2012 and still no falcon crest season 3. I could be dead before I see this wonderful series again\\n__label__1 Dense essays about man\\'s 20th century blahs: There are very few books that I have been unable to finish because of ennui, but this was one of them. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and had to call it quits. This book badly needs editing. Percy asks some engaging questions to begin the book, but it is all downhill from there.\\n__label__1 Should not be listed in this category: These are short pieces of movies about Glen Gould not paino music performences. You don\\'t see any real Glen Gould playing piano in this DVD. In that regard I am dissapointed or I might have been misled to think these are some documentary films about Glen Gould. Actor Colm Feore\\'s performences in #6 Hamburg and #9 LA Concert are two of the interesting pieces to see. But in my opinon this DVD should not be listed in the Musucal and Performing Arts category where most people buy DVD\\'s are ofter watch the performences again and over again such as Glen Gould\\'s Goldburg Variations. I centaily will not watch this DVD again.\\n__label__2 quite interesting: It gave the dinosaurs a mind and a story. It was humorus at times. It was intertaining. The animation was well done.\\n__label__2 Vanessa\\'s greatest.The most talented Miss America ever: I didn\\'t pay attention to Vanessa Williams records played on the radio untill I heard \"Dreaming\" in the late 80\\'s. I was amazed at her beutifull,sweet voice.\"Save the best for last,\" and\"The Sweetest Days\" are my favorites also.I still have to laugh when I hear \"Colors of the Wind\" played on the radio.I remember when Vanessa sang this song on the Oscars,and when she was done,Whoopi Golberg said,\"I always wanted to know what color my wind is.\"\\n__label__1 Single layer release in America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: While the European PAl format release is a DVD-9, i.e. a DOUBLE LAYER with 8.5 Gb of video and audio data, they used a DVD-5 i.e. a SINGLE LAYER disc for the NTSC release in America.This means video has been recompressed and a lot of quality was lost.I have not seen the PAL release, but I can assume the quality is so much better.The music is excellent, and the sound quality is very good despite the use of Dolby Digital instead of LPCM (CD quality) for the audio tracks.\\n__label__1 Could have been 4 stars........: The first DVD that I received had a momentary pause and then something flashed on the screen for a moment. This appeared on any DVD player, apparently some sort of a defect when putting the production together. Amazon replaced the disk without a problem but the replacement DVD predictably did the same. I don\\'t have the patience to keep returning the thing until the error is corrected. That\\'s a shame because the concert was different than most others, a nice mix of Anderson\\'s lighter music and classics, and quite enjoyable. I would have rated this a 4 if I could get a DVD that wasn\\'t flawed.\\n__label__2 an awesome experience: This dvd is awesome! I\\'m in awe of Ian Anderson and have been since the 70\\'s but this took my enchantment to another level withthe classical part incorporated into the rock. I thought it was well edited and included shots of the whole band. I really gota kick out of the expressions on the orchestra\\'s faces and how they were enjoying their experience as well. If you\\'re a fan ofJethro Tull, this will round out your collection.\\n__label__2 a great book froma great author: Hey all, Harlan Ellison will be at The Booksmith in San Francisco for areading & booksigning on September 15th at 6:30 pmThe Booksmith has set up a special Ellison page highlighting the new andout-of-print books and spoken word recordings available by Ellison. Thepage is located at http://www.booksmith.com/cosmikdebris/ellison.htm\\n__label__2 Love It!: Well, you just cannot go wrong with anything Psych - I just love these characters - They remind me of me and my friends when we were younger.\\n__label__1 Ordinary stories - makes audience bored and silly: This is one of the most flopped Psych seasons/series, ever.I was, and still a big fan of Shawn and Gus - but there are few stories in this season which make audience ridiculously bored and silly. Few of such are: \"The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man\", \"Dead Man\\'s Curveball\", \"Indiana Shawn And The Temple Of...\", \"Let\\'s Doo-Wap it Again\", \" Autopsy Turvy\", and many more.Compared to earlier seasons, in this season both Shawn and Gus are less-funny-more-silly, forget about being \\'interesting\\' characters.Thus, before buying it, borrow it from the local library, watch the episode then go for purchase - because Amazon still sells such an ordinary, Non-Bluray season with pretty high price($40) !!!Real value of such ordinary season should be around $10\\n__label__1 Love the show HATE the download!: If you have the choice of waiting for the DVD\\'s to be released, WAIT. The downloads are glitchy and frustrating to watch ( I have access to all levels of computers and had ALL of them do this from Mac\\'s to Dells, toshiba and asus) Very unhappy. Love the show and mad that I can\\'t easily watch the season I need to , to catch up with the series.\\n__label__2 Awesome: This show never fails to make me laugh! Always can identify with the 90\\'s reference quips! We Absolutely LOVE it!!!\\n__label__2 Great: If you have the rest of the series, you won\\'t want to miss out on this one. I can\\'t wait for the next season to come out on DVD.\\n__label__2 Great fun for the whole family!: If you\\'re looking for a fun show that everyone in the family can enjoy, this is it. You don\\'t have to worry about off-color humor, profanity, scary scenes, nudity, sex, drugs, or anything else distasteful you might not want the little ones exposed to. Shows like this are a rarity these days!\\n__label__2 Still great: While not as funny as some of the previous seasons, Psych still makes us laugh every time. Shawn and Gus are great together, and the back-and-forth between the characters delivers, even if the plots don\\'t tickle your funnybone.I know some people didn\\'t like it, but the \"Hangover\"-themed episode made us laugh till our sides hurt.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t buy it!: I agree with John Bellis. Very strange and unintuitive interface. Maps not at all up to date. Customer support nonexistent (wait up to an hour and then asked if want to spend ... dollars for support). Delorme makes Microsoft seem bland when it comes to sucking more money out of users for upgrades. You might note that they are not continuing this particular software (Road Warrior) I wonder why?! Also, you can use their software with other GPS units but not their unit with other software. The people who are giving favorable reviews must work for Delorme.\\n__label__2 Great product but buy it SOMEWHERE ELSE: I agree with all the recommendations but DO NOT BUY IT ON AMAZON. I got it from Home Depot (same 3 bags, 60 days each, same weight/dimensions) but it is only $7.89 at Home Depot (plus no $14 for shipping) if you have a Home Depot give them a call before blowing an extra 36 bucks on this! but DO buy it. they really work!\\n__label__2 Easy Installation: Scanner was very easy to install and use for the first time. I am very pleased with it.\\n__label__1 don t buy this!: can lide 70 was much easier to use, software wise.this program is so freakin over complicated.....its not menat for the busy person who needs hours to figure out its filing system. the 70 was much much better. we wasted our money on this piece of crap\\n__label__2 It\\'s great!: I bought it based on other Amazon reviews and the price. I figured for the price, if it is mediocre then so be it. But, actually, I\\'m quite happy with its performance and quality. I specifically wanted it to scan in an extensive photo library as a way of fulfilling a New Year\\'s resolution to finally organize all those years\\' of pictures. It is serving this purpose quite well.\\n__label__1 Avoid at all costs: I bought two for 30 bucks each, but I think they cost less than a dollar to make. I\\'ve already exchanged the first pair I had, and the new ones are just as bad or worse. Here are the defects I\\'ve experienced so far:- The part where the microphone holder screws on has come loose and rotates freely. This is one of the first two that I exchanged.- All of the adjustment knobs are different, and none of them are easy to use. Some get in the way of each other when you\\'re trying to secure it!- It\\'s impossible to secure the rotation on the second pair I got. The first were fine. I\\'m guessing this is another artifact of cheap manufacturing.- All of the adjustments are either loose or very tight to rotate. Some of them go from loose to stuck in just a few degrees of rotation.- There are many more defects, but I\\'m getting angry just writing about this, recalling my futile attempts to get these set up.Summary: Avoid at all costs! You\\'re better off using duct tape and a broomstick.\\n__label__2 A Walk Down Memory Lane: I was watching a U tube video about Linda Ronstadt, and wondered if I could get a CD of hers. I went to my favorite site, Amazon, and typed it in. Up popped all her old records, now on CD. I had gotten rid of my record collection years ago, because we live in an RV now and don\\'t have the room. I was excited about finding a collection of her best hits. I didn\\'t need all 8 records again, just my favorite ones. They were all here on this one long playing CD!! Life is good, when you can put on a CD and relive those 60s, 70s and your youth!! Now, I want to find the Monkees. Oh joy!\\n__label__2 Great Cooking System: It is very easy to assemble, works great even under windy condition. Make sure you also purchase the cover to protect it from rusting.\\n__label__2 Great burner: This burner is built with very good quality. Easy to set up and very sturdy. I use it in Garage so no problem with the low flame, It\\'s about 0 - 100 % adjustable. The heat is much stronger then the oven in kitchen great for any kind cooking. Very happy.\\n__label__2 Indispensable: If I lose power, I can still cook! I gave one to my sister, too and they like it, too!\\n__label__2 Camp Cbef Explorer 2: Ordered just in time to use for a large gathering in conjunction with my wife\\'s 50th birthday celebration, with approximately 40 friends and family in attendance. Using two large 20 qrt stock pots and a cast iron skillet, cooked a large batch of shrimp and grits with the Camp Chef. For starters, it took me no more than a few minutues to set it up and then I was cooking. Loved it. Set up, ease of use, results all fantastic. Can\\'t wait to use it for future large gatherings. Very sold and sturdy. I can tell it will serve me well for years to come.\\n__label__2 Good steady pace: This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic. The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout. Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you\\'re happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work. As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline.\\n__label__1 Really needed a ghost writer: Too much back story, too much opinining, not enough story. I got the part about how much the author believed in the mission, but that became too repetitive. So did the part about how evil Saddam and his henchmen were. I was an interrogator in Iraq. I know the back story. I know about Saddam. I wanted to read this author\\'s story, but the writing quality just isn\\'t there.\\n__label__2 this cd is GREAT!!!!!: anyone who wants to be cheered up fast should get this cd. it\\'s the most uplifting cd ever! if you like this one, try all the other hanson cds. you will not be disappointed! also, if you want something a tiny bit less \"poppy\" try the moffatts.\\n__label__1 Too Heavy to Ship or Carry: Bought this behemoth for a daughter going to study in Spain. Took a bit to receive, then, realized it is so heavy that it cannot be shipped to Spain reasonably (it would cost as much as I bought it for). One might think they would advise purchasers about this in advance (since they proclaim themselves to be the overseas adapter experts). It sits in its original unopened box in my garage & I will sell to anyone wanting it for $10... maybe $8.\\n__label__2 Interesting: The book was pretty good as I recall (it was a while back when I read the book). If I remember right, the book seemed liked it ended TOO abruptly (Mazer left \\'ya hanging). But after searching on Amazon I see why: There\\'s a Sequel. It was A good book overall.P.s. If I recall corectly, There was some mild profanity in it.\\n__label__1 Incorrect Fit: Bought this item readily after the amazon website confirmed its the right fit for my vehicle. When it arrived, I opened the package only to realize that it had a male connector. The one in my car (the faulty one) has a female connector. Please be mindful of this while ordering.\\n__label__1 Shallow Water: This is a grossly dishonest work dealing with the historical Jesus. Herzog fails to credibly deal with the relevant NT textual matter not to mention addressing and genuinely interacting with scholarship that finds much more to the historical Jesus than Herzog\\'s unplatable academic gruel indicates. He has very little to say about very much; one can thus wade through the shallow waters of Herzog\\'s Prophet and Teacher never getting one\\'s feet wet.Try the following for a good trip through the land of modern historical Jesus scholarship:Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels As Eyewitness TestimonyDale G. \"Skip\" Wagner, Jr.\\n__label__2 A Fair Product: This is a good product. I have used this product for one year, and already I\\'m typing 55 words per minute. I started last year, sixth grade, and I\\'m typing almost as fast as my mom. This game is really fun because you learn while playing games.\\n__label__2 FIVE STAR: GREAT, AWARD WINNING BRITISH FILM, PROBABLY WHY IT COST SO MUCH!! SUPERIOR PHOTOGRAPHY, SUPERIOR ACTING.BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FROM AMAZON THAN MANY OTHER BRITISH FILMS.\\n__label__1 Are you serious?: I heard such wonderful things about this movie and was really looking forward to seeing it. I had a couple friends over to watch it and out of the four of us I was the only one left awake to see the end. I was so disappointed. The movie was too long and left me feeling cheated at the end. So gald I didnt buy it. Rent it first before buying...\\n__label__1 It does not work: DVD would not work in any of my players even the new ones. It came with a little note in it that tells you you need new software to get it to run in most DVD players. I am returning it.\\n__label__2 Simply the most beautiful movie ever made: This is, by far, the most beautiful movie ever made. E.M. Forster\\'s masterpiece is lovingly brought to the screen by Merchant-Ivory and an impeccable cast. If you somehow fail to fall in love with this film, you have no soul. The writing is superb, sets and scenery divine, and casting dead-on.\\n__label__1 Terrible BD Transfer: I bought the \"Special Edition\" BBC Video Blu-ray version that bears the following caveat: \"Due to the age and nature of the film, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and sound quality. Wherever possible, we have sought out and restored the original materials to ensure the best possible quality.\" This is no restored version. The Blu-ray version was no better than a DVD version. I was terribly disappointed. Sony should guard it\\'s Blu-ray reputation!\\n__label__2 Simply Spiffing! A Dreamy Delight.: The original, quintessential, Merchant-Ivory film. Helena Bonham Carter as the lovely and lost Miss Lucy Honeychurch, on holiday in Florence with her cousin, played by Dame Maggie Smith. With Daniel Day-Lewis at his most uptight, and the only role Julian Sands can be proud of. When I was 16 my best-friend and I would put on our best Victorian threads and eat chocolates while we savored Freddy\\'s hair, Lucy\\'s Temper and \"poor Charlotte\". Not to mention George.\\n__label__1 terribly done: shipping was fast, however it was terribly done, the gold tone was not flat and with a lot of bubbles inside, so it make the pin looks very cheap\\n__label__2 Great buy: I am very happy with yall guys and from my family i would like to say thank you for all your help i will make sure to tell everyone to buy from yall all...\\n__label__2 This year\\'s downer: I enjoyed this book, but expected more from it than I got. The characters were well developed but seem to sleep walk through the story. There was no real heat between the main characters, they seemed to seek each other out for warmth and comfort not because they truly cared about each other, which is OK, I guess, if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Some of the scenes in the book were brutal, like the West is (was) back then. But the characters seemed to hold back their emotions from everyone, including us.\\n__label__1 Bogus: I ordered this CD and expected it in a short period of time, per the ad. After three months, I was notified that Amazon could not locate the item, and my order was cancelled. That same day I saw the same item on Amazon, \"available for shipping in 1-2 business days\" at 5 to 6 times the price when I ordered it.\\n__label__1 Incorrect information: I bought this atlas several months ago, and loved it. However, I just discovered a major mistake on page 6: Birmingham is listed as the capital of Alabama. (I checked elsewhere to make sure that the capital had not moved from Montgomery.) If this basic information is incorrect, it makes me wonder how many other errors exist, and if I can trust only the information that I know from other sources. Very disappointing!\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t seem to do much: I haven\\'t really seen any evidence that using this product actually does anything. My filters still get mildewy and the water, if left sitting for more than a day or two, does the same. I suspect bleach would actually work better and be a much cheaper option.\\n__label__1 Slow and Unsatisfying: Movie was slow and hard to watch. Not very satisfying. Would have made a better TV show than a full length movie.\\n__label__1 Put me to sleep: Within 15 minutes I was dozing...looked over and my husband was asleep as well. Very boring - turned it off.\\n__label__1 Good acting, but very boring!!!: If you\\'re looking for a suspenseful movie, don\\'t look here. The acting is good, but there is no suspense because it\\'s slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn\\'t unfolds until the very end of the movie.\\n__label__1 Slow, Dull: The fact that it\\'s a true story makes it interesting alone - but the plot line, the music, the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways. I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out.\\n__label__1 Should have followed by instincts and stopped watching: I usually don\\'t write reviews for Amazon, but this movie was so bad I wanted to try to save others from my misery. 1/3 of the way through, I was really tempted to stop watching, but kept telling myself that it might get better. It never did. I have Amazon Prime so I\\'m not out any money, but I did waste my time.\\n__label__1 Unable to care about the characters: While others see Gosling as having done a great job, my own response is that he did, if what he was going for was boring. His character should have been interesting. Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst\\'s devotion to him. As a result I didn\\'t care about any of the characters. I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed.\\n__label__1 very good text book: It is a very good text book, but the pictures would be colored. Color pictures are important for the patologist veterinary and for the students.\\n__label__2 Book of Lilies: I bought this book because I was interested to know about the different kind of lilies. This book has beautiful picture of them.\\n__label__2 Great Buy: Wonderful buy I got this upon hearing the very sad news about Ronnie James Dio and his death rock and roll will never be the same again, but the seller was great and very fast shipping. I would definetly reccomend this seller\\n__label__1 Muddled thinking, crass, inelegant style: Reviewed by a woman. I struggled through the first thirty pages, but could not get through the bad writing. He distorts the concept of manhood assuming it to be the most negative and degenerate form of masculinity, and then goes ahead to \"deconstruct\" it. Man-haters will love it, men searching for the meaning of manhood will waste their time with it.\\n__label__1 Rubbish!: I am sorry I bought it; what a waste of money and time. Predictable made for television junk. Jane Horricks is a wonderful actor but has chosen poorly the films she has starred in. She would be better off for having passed on this.\\n__label__1 Read before ordering this CD: As an avid fan of slot and video poker software, I was extremely disappointed with this product. The entire CD ONLY HAD 3 games on it - one video poker machine and two slot machines. No wonder it only took about 30 seconds to install! This CD has more film clips and adds pushing a trip to Vegas, than it has the actual games themselves. Do yourself a favor - do not order this product.\\n__label__1 C\\'est Brigitte!: At times I can\\'t really comprehend Brigitte Bardot\\'s fame- she\\'s sexy, yes, and a fairly okay actress, but as a singer, she\\'s just alright. Her music is not essential, but if you are into 1960\\'s French music it\\'s not all that bad. There are some great songs on this disc, not really worth buying the whole album, but still a fun listen.\\n__label__1 Simply Horrible: If there was 0 star, I would have given 0 star instead of 1 star. This earrings are horrible and 1000 times smaller than what looks in pic. I had bought engagement ring from Amazon and had a great experience so went for this one. But ended up returning this item as soon as I got it. Even for 10 bucks I wouldn\\'t buy these earrings.\\n__label__1 Got what I paid for: The price was too good to be true. Although the size of the diamonds is accurate, they lack sparkle. My CZ\\'s are prettier. Fortunately, these were for my 17 year old daughter. I didn\\'t to spend a great deal in case she lost one. I wouldn\\'t recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale.\\n__label__1 Horrible.. DO NOT Waste your time: Please don\\'t make the mistake I did by ordering these earrings. I did not read the reviews of other people regarding these as I should have. They do not look at all like real diamonds. They do not sparkle. They honestly look like stones made out of plastic. Although, plastic might shine more than these.They are not worth the money at all!\\n__label__1 Do not order this item: The quality is simply terrible. They were so cloudy, you almost would have thought they weren\\'t even diamonds. Also, one of the two had a black fleck in it too.\\n__label__1 Poor color: I expected these earrings to be small but the color and clarity is much worse than I expected. The diamonds look milky white and have not sparkle. I would not spend a dime on this piece.\\n__label__1 Worst looking diamond I have ever seen: I saw the negative reviews and, despite them, decided to give these a shot. The second I took them out of the package I knew that they were going right back. These are UTTERLY the worst looking diamonds I have ever seen, even for $99. I am not a diamond expert but a diamond should not a have milky white color.The good thing is Amazon makes returns easy...\\n__label__1 Not good for VGA presentations: We bought this projector for training presentations. We are now in the processes of returning it. The 5 year old projector we have has a more legible text output. I\\'m not sure what the problem is, from other reviews this projector is great for movies. If you are looking for a VGA presentation projector this is NOT the solution.\\n__label__1 Very BAD quality: I placed an order to buy these stickers with RED Arabic letters for my white Apple wireless keyboard, but what I received was with WHITE letters so they didn\\'t work. Fortunately, I have a MacBook Pro with black keyboard, so I decided to use them, BUT, each sticker can cover about 75% of each key. As a result, I threw them in the trash.The worst thing that happened after this purchase was when I received and email from Amazon Market Place asking me to rate this order and the seller, so I wrote exactly what I mentioned above, the next day I received an email from the seller who insisted that it was my mistake because I ordered stickers with white letters not red and that I needed them for my PC not for my mac! plus, the way that the seller has wrote their email to me was very rude and I saved their email. Well, I\\'m writing a review right now on the product that I purchased which indicates that it is with red letters not white.\\n__label__1 Umax Astra 2000U: The scanner has never scanned since new. I can understand a unit being shipped factory without firmware. Mistakes happen. But the Umax customer service is just plain lousy. The \"Get them off the phone\" and \"don\\'t answer e-mails\" policy is an insult. I\\'ll pay a little more and by an office HP.\\n__label__1 Umax products $ucks!: do not buy umax products... it is a total waste of money.most of the time the drivers and software provided by the company does not work with the operating system you are using. in order for it to work properly you must go to their web site and download a patch that supposed to fix the problem but instead the patch conflicts with other softeware such as camera software or even the operating system (one more thing the drivers and patches at their website are not free).I wrote to umax and they have never responded to any of the emails i have sent to them. I decided to call the support center and I was refered back to the website to download another patch. (very bad customer support)\\n__label__1 Scanner is very picky: I bought this scanner several years ago and have felt like I wasted my money. It did okay under Windows 98SE, but I had problems getting it to work under Windows 2000 Pro. I had to download the W2K software/drivers (none provided with the original CD), which took forever, of course.To make matters worse, I upgraded my computer last month from a PII 400 to an AMD XP 1800 with an ASUS A7S333 motherboard, 80 GB Maxtor hard drive, and 512 MB Kingston DDR RAM. I kept the same video card, DVD & CDRW drives, etc. I reloaded Windows 2000, loaded the software/drivers, and nothing happened.After trying for a week, I gave up. I tried to find updated drivers on the Umax site, but no, they wanted me to fork over [money]to ship a CD to me. Harrumph.So, it now sits on the floor and acts as a cat perch. That\\'s about all it\\'s worth.\\n__label__2 Good scanner with decent software package: I\\'ve used this scanner for over a year now and find the total package to be quite good. The scanner tends to scan images a bit dark, but that is easily corrected with the included imaging software (I actually use PaintShop Pro to adjust the brightness). The OCR (OmniPage LE)does a fairly good job, but free OCR software will never be the match of $100.00 programs. I scan images almost exclusively for posting to websites. The scans are fairly quick, even with the 30-second warm-up for the first scan. You get quite a bit of bundled software, some of which is redundant (how many graphics programs do you really need?). I use the copy utility much more than I thought I ever would. I even put a shortcut of the Copier on the desktop so I can copy quickly. In short, this is a pretty good scanner with some decent included software and a great USB interface!\\n__label__2 The Men\\'s House - BRILLIANT!: I am a Master Mason in Southern California who has read & studied countless Masonic writings, tests, and books. Many are hokie, many are incorrect...however, every once in awhile, a great piece of work comes along. \"The Men\\'s House\" is one of these works. This book was written to be enjoyed & understood by everyone - Masons & non-Masons alike. If you would like a peek into the world that Masons enjoy & wish upon the rest of humanity, this is the one. Very inspirational & thought provoking, this book is a must-read/must-own. CHRIS\\n__label__2 Memories that last a lifetime: I watched all these videos as a child and they began a lifelong love of natural science for me! They have a way of making science interesting for children. I recommend them!I\\'m getting all nostalgic now.\\n__label__1 The 2.5 oval was broken. Im getting really tired of this. There is no need to say any more. Broken.: I have to write 20 words on broken. The rack cant even be used with that dish broken. By the way one of the lids is too small.\\n__label__2 Save The Shipping and Handling Charges: This is a great product as all corningware is but why buy it from Target and pay almost $20 in shipping and handling when you can buy it direct from Amazon and it qualifies for free super savings shipping?\\n__label__2 Old School Flavor w/New School Hits: Art Official Intelligence... Who would have thought that De La would have stood so strong? The new album is fresh and innovative with hooks that are off the hook. Various artists that appear on tracks add flavors of R&B as well as old school rap. Thank you Beastie! AOI gives us somthing to think about as well something to dance to. Change of pace. Thanks to De La.\\n__label__2 I\\'m partial to this album because I\\'m a De La head!!!!: I love all of De La\\'s albums... as any Native Tongues junkie would!!! I have all 5 DeLa albums sitting right next to the Tribe, Latifah, and Jungle Brothers collections. Clearly, \"3 feet high and rising\" is EVERYONE\\'S favorite De La album... but if you\\'re old school, how can you not like De La? Favorite Tracks on this CD: \"Set The Mood\", \"Thru Ya City\", \"All Good\", and \"Copa\".\\n__label__2 REMARKABLE: ABIDE WITH ME is remarkable, just over-the-moon good. This is what real writing and perfect storytelling are all about. Liz Strout definitely has the gift.\\n__label__2 Spirtitual Inadequacy and Redemption: I really enjoyed Strout\\'s earlier novel, AMY AND ISABELLE, so when this book came out (seven years later!), I was willing to give it a read, sight unseen.ABIDE WITH ME is a testament to Strout\\'s skills. She manages to get an avowed secular humanist (me!) to dive deeply into this portrait of a Congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife. Feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced, he starts to lose faith in himself. Eventually, his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well.Although the book deals with inner turmoil, there is a lot of dryly spun New England humor in it as well, a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture. I just hope that I don\\'t have to wait another seven years for Strout\\'s next gem of a novel.\\n__label__1 Left Me Cold: It\\'s so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us, not literary reviews. Human nature is so diverse. The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book. But for me, I don\\'t know that this was the worst book I\\'ve read in the last few months, but it came close. I couldn\\'t have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold. I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book. Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game.\\n__label__1 Mega Marbles New Generation Marble Set: Not a good choice for our little grandchild as the marbles are too big to use in Quercetti Marble Run with Motorized Elevator. Sad part is it broke that other game on Christmas Day!\\n__label__2 Tells the Untold Story of the Holocaust: Piotrowski masterfully discusses and documents many topics usually avoided in traditional Holocaust education. These include: the collaboration of Jews with both Nazis and Communists, the murder of 3 million Polish gentiles by the Germans, and the deportation of 1.5 million Polish gentiles to Siberia by the Russians (where most of them died--not in gas chambers, but from disease and starvation). Must read for anyone interested in then FULL account of the Holocaust.\\n__label__1 Where\\'s the dial indicator?: looked like a nice enough scale, but it had no indicator. After a few quick shakes i heard it rattling around around inside the scale. Thank God for Amazon\\'s easy return policy.\\n__label__1 Horrible, horrible, horrible...: This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I spent almost $30.00 on this book and felt totally ripped off. Brad Knight speculates on what he felt like happened to Laci, and why Scott did it, etc. I don\\'t care what he \"speculates\" happened to Laci, I want facts and there wasn\\'t any given in this book. He then goes on to bore us about his take on the O.J. Simpson murder case (as if this has anything to do with the Peterson case-don\\'t ask.) He rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases, but his theories are based on speculation, rumors, etc. The fact the title of the book is \"Laci Peterson: The Whole Story\" is a joke...the book ends even before the trial. He is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended...boy, that\\'s one book I won\\'t be buying. If you want to read the definitive book on the Laci Peterson murder case read Catherine Crier\\'s great book, \"A Deadly Game\".\\n__label__1 Couldn\\'t even finish the book!: I bought this book in hopes that it would offer additional insight into the Laci Peterson case. I paid around $30.00 for this book and couldn\\'t even finish it! The author included all these personal stories about himself, that had nothing to do with the case at all! There were so many stories about himself, that I found myself skipping through the book, just trying to find content about the actual case. I finally said enough, and put it away for good. I let my aunt have it, and she only got through the second chapter. My advice is to save your money.\\n__label__1 Book was OK, software was not: This book was useful, but the software was a disappointment. the sofware was not very similar to the actual GRE test.\\n__label__2 Good product!: The other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly, but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five.\\n__label__1 Not fine jewelry: I was looking for some nice jewelry to give our 14 and 16 year old nieces. This is not it. This will end up as a present for the 10 year old niece because we got it at the Friday sale price of $15. The pendant is smaller than the on-screen picture, smaller even than the fingernail on my ,ittle finger, and the stone is so small it is hard to see.If I had paid the $45 they ask for it regularly I would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund... evven at only $15 I am tempted to send it back.\\n__label__1 This show is NOT OKAY!: Its a very violent show that leaves you feeling horrible every time you watch it. The main characters get away with killling, drug dealing...shooting young boys. With all the tragedies in our country, this show is an extremely violent and bad example to the young generation who may be watching. The only proper ending would be for the main characters to get caught by the DEA!\\n__label__2 Such a great show.: This series is starting out to be as good as the previous that captured my attention. With the removal of Gustavo from the picture the scare element of before is mostly gone but they were able to successfully add to the existing drama that seemed to end in season 4. Good times.\\n__label__2 Great show.: The good - well written and acted show. Plot twists, real enough.The bad - not one of the characters is a good person. Like, 4 parts bad qualities to 1 part redeeming qualities . This show creates anxiety, which I guess could count as a good just as easy.\\n__label__2 Great Series: RIVITING ! Next to Dexter this is my favorite program... This certainly beats watching the election campaign and conventions. Hope they make another season.\\n__label__2 Little sparkling gems!: I just received these earrings, amazingly quickly from Amazon (thank you!) and I really love them. They are tinier than I expected, but they still look beautiful as I prefer small earrings. The sapphires are deep blue, almost black, but they shine in the light, due to their beautiful facets. The diamond in the middle is tiny but it lightens the flower. I\\'ll try to buy the other same earrings with ruby, and emerald.\\n__label__1 Might Be A Good Product, but...: ...the nozzle arrived obliterated in 10+ pieces. The box was fine so I do not blame UPS. Might have been damaged from the warehouse and shifting destroyed it. Actually it looks like someone took the nozle off, stepped on it, then stuck it in the box. I\\'m not saying that\\'s what happened, but you get the idea of what it looked like. The nozzle is important on this, so it is now useless. These things happen, I understand, but BEWARE this is not returnable due to being classified as hazardous. I can\\'t see how this could be classified as such, but I did not see it. I guess that is my fault for not reading the whole page. However I have to rate this as an Amazon FAIL. Left a packaging feedback, but no response is promised or likely. I can\\'t find a customer service link to talk to someone about it. I will update my rating if this is resolved, but it doesn\\'t look good right now.\\n__label__2 Gran colección: Disfruté completamente de este álbum. Aquí están las listas de canciones:1 Te lo Pido2 Teniendote a Ti3 Necesito de Tu Amor4 Mi Casa Chica5 No Lastimes Mas6 Ando Buscando Novia7 Telenovela8 Estoy Loco por Ti9 Perdido en las Copas10 Nomas, Nomas11 Diario de Mi Vida12 Mi Cafetal\\n__label__2 Breast Cancer Husband\\'s...Get This Book!: You\\'ll need this advice one way or another. There are some topics you may not want to deal with, but trust me, you WILL deal with them. Your wife\\'s cancer diagnosis doesn\\'t come with a manual...this book is a great start. (Even though you wish you weren\\'t reading it...once the dust settles...you\\'ll be thankful for it.)\\n__label__2 So very helpful: My husband is not a book reader, but he read this book cover to cover. It scared him, but let him know what to expect. He was a wonderful caretaker. This book helped him get ready and know what to do, as well as what \"Not\" to say! We give it to other couples that have been diagnosed.\\n__label__2 Price and results - a double threat treatment!: The price of this eye creme is outstanding. Then I tried it and it is THE BEST eye creme I\\'ve ever used. I normally spent $40+ on eye treatments and now I don\\'t have to. I will never switch from V\\'TAE Eye treatment, I am hooked!\\n__label__2 You\\'re going to want this strategy guide if you want access to the best wanzer in the game.: As usual, nothing about this game is hard enough to warrant a strategy guide, but you\\'re going to want this one if you want to get your hands on the best wanzer in the game, the Hoshun. There are also a lot of other secrets that you might miss if you don\\'t at least have this guide handy.\\n__label__2 Great movie!: I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, but by the end of this movie, I was in love with it! It is a great story, a little tragic, but still worth the time to watch it.\\n__label__1 Could of been great: The first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner. After that things went amiss. You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o\\'s I found. It got to the point where I just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration. I could go on but then I would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair.\\n__label__2 Not just lycanthropes: Gripping horror is often about the desires, both positive and negative, surrounding the family. Such is the case with Richard Leefs novel, a tale of brotherly competition gone bad illuminated by the supernatural. When a down-on-his-luck photographer accidentally shoots photos of a murder, he becomes the target for supernatural vengeancecor was he the target to begin with? The werewolf is perhaps one of those classic monsters most rich with symbolic possibilities, and Lee employs here an interesting conceit. When horror works, it not only scares us, it illuminates something dark in all of us. We look forward to more from this writer\\n__label__1 Guilt By Association: I think anyone reading this book will feel that they have been made to feel guilty. To me, more than trying to help with these feelings, the book does more to bring them to your attention and you begin to think - OMG - what am I doing with my kids and I should feel guilty about it !The book is an easy read and does not do much to answer any questions in my opinion. It may make you feel better however, because it says its ok to feel guilty. In the end - the book did little for me.\\n__label__2 Outstanding book: An outstanding book. I myself knew absolutely nothing about electricity when I first bought this book - although obviously it didn\\'t make me an expert, it nonetheless taught me what I needed to know to start modifying my boat\\'s electrical systems. I admit that I am biased - Don Casey is one of my favorite sailing authors - but if you are a novice and need to upgrade your boat\\'s electrics, this is the book to get.\\n__label__1 Doesn\\'t work/not worth the money!: I purchased this as a gift and we were excited to start using it right away, however our potatos were a little old and starting to go soft, but we thought why not. Even with softer potatoes this was horrible to use. Took so much effort to push the potato through and the end was never completely cut.Not being ones to give up we cleaned it up (not easy to do by the way) and put it aside until we had new potatos to see if that made a difference. It did not.Trying to line everything up, pushing, etc was difficult. We then tried the smaller blade for smaller fries thinking perhaps it was the blades, but that was even worse.Just a horrible waste of money, ended up returning it.Would not recommend.\\n__label__1 worst junk ever: Worst piece of Chinese junk I ever purchased.Only fits half of a potatoe and can\\'t even stand up to that.I used it three times and the handle broke, a blade bent and came out and the blade frame cracked. Save your money and leave this one in China.\\n__label__1 Weekend cook: Sorry but this is a total piece of junk. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Don\\'t waste your money. Spend a little more and get quality.\\n__label__1 Poor construction quality: I purchased this item after reading the positive reviews here at Amazon.It arrived today and I am pretty disappointed about the poor quality of construction. The box overall is somewhat flimsy and can easily be twisted and bent (it feels like thin leather wrapped over a cardboard body frame).The latch sticks, so it doesn\\'t operate smoothly or easily and the lid doesn\\'t open quite enough to balance properly so it sometimes falls closed by itself.On the plus side, the interior pockets and features are nicely appointed in cushy-soft velvet and the watch holders fit my watches nicely and snugly.I had thought that at this median price the build quality and fit/finish would be better. It is disappointing enough that I will probably buy something else.\\n__label__2 A Must-have for Wisconsin Winter: I\\'ve had Yaktrax before and wore them out after several winters. I use them when shovelling and walking my dogs. These are great on icy roads or sidewalks. I can slip them onto my sneakers or boots (buy a size larger if your boots are heavily insulated with large soles) and no longer \\'ice skate\\' when walking.\\n__label__2 Great item to survive the winter: I bought these before here in town and loved them. The pair I originally bought still are great. I needed a couple of pair to place strategically at work and in the car in the event of snow and I wasn\\'t ready. Now I\\'m ready.These Yaktrax are great for those hard to see places. Is is just wet or is is ice? I don\\'t have to worry if I have these on. They provide great grip and give me more confidence when walking.Warning! Don\\'t wear them on tile or hard wood floor, you\\'ll slip and fall! Not to mention possibily damage your floor.\\n__label__1 Great when they work...: These things work great when they aren\\'t falling off your boots due to the rubber bands breaking. I am a police officer in Alaska and items like these are a necessity due to the weather. However, I was only able to wear these on shift 3 times before the rubber bands broke. I\\'m quite disappointed in the lack of quality, not the performance. The materials they use are cheap... some rubber and thin metal wire. The unit cost to make these I bet are in the 25-50 cent range and they charge somewhere near $15! I would gladly pay $15 all day long if the product had good durability.\\n__label__2 Exceptional: I am as good as Consumer Reports but cheaper. These aregreat; convenient, light weight, durable, effective.Not for in-door use; therefore must be put on - where? -in a cold garage? - and taken off in a cold garage (forexample). Which isn\\'t ideal - if the Yaktrax are wet andcold and iced up.BUT. My best friend could have used a pair recentlywhen he was simply fetching mail. Broke his leg inthree places on an icy path.\\n__label__1 2 months, tops.: The product absolutely works, but you\\'re lucky if you get more than 2 months out of a pair. All they would have to do is solder/weld the wires closed, but instead, they have very strong, lose, sharp wires wrapped around rubber. Also, the product has a tenancy to fall off your shoes midstride at random times.Do not buy.\\n__label__1 Yaktrax Walker Durability: I was very excited when I first tried on the Yaktrax walkers. I have a very steep driveway. Clearing off snow can get very challenging with slippery winter weather. The Yaktrax walkers worked great the first time. The second time I used them, they also fell off a couple times. The third time I used them the \"sturdy outerband\" broke. Not sure how they can call it \"sturdy\" If you plan on using these for anything substantial, I would recommend looking at a different product.\\n__label__2 safe and secure: In my 20\\'s I had a very serious fall on black ice. Since then, anytime I knew there was going to be icy weather, or anytime there was melted snow that would freeze overnight, I was fearful of going out for anything. I\\'ve already used my Yaktrax this year, and I\\'m no longer afraid. I feel safe and secure and look forward to stepping out. THEY\\'RE GREAT!!! Thank you!\\n__label__2 New to winter: Having moved from Florida to upstate NY with no knowledge of winter, the traction cleats have been a life saver. Since I don\\'t always want to wear large snow boots, these cleats make it easy for me to wear more fashionable shoes and still make it to my car in one piece on those cold, icy mornings.\\n__label__2 These really work: I have problem ankles. My ligaments have been rebuilt by basket-weaving them with a tendon. One of my ankle tendons has been shatter and removed. Stability is vital to my safety. I am amazed on how well yaktrax supplies firm footing. Before using yaktrax, I felt a prisoner of winter; now I am no longer homebound during snow days. I feel free to venture out.\\n__label__2 Excellent Product: This is an excellent product for anyone who lives where it snows or it\\'s icy. Last year I slipped on our ice in the driveway so I thought I\\'d give these a try. It\\'s just like walking on dry land. Incredible!! They are easy to put on but definetly take them off in your garage or outside before you walk into your house because they will rip the crap out of your flooring!!\\n__label__2 No more worries on the snow and ice: After a slip and fall on the ice in the middle of the street in front of a bus, I became terrified of any spot on the ground that appeared wet. I told my doctor about my fall and she suggested Yak Trax. Of course I laughed at the name but went on line and ordered. Tried them out and loved them.\\n__label__2 Safely Walk On Snow And Ice!: Yaktraxs are lightweight and easily stretch over shoes and boots. They give EXCELLENT tractionon ice or snow. A must for anyone, especially if you live where snow and ice are a commonoccurance. A great product!\\n__label__2 A Winter Essential in Certain Parts of North America: If you walk on ice, you\\'ll find these very nice. And much less expensive than a broken bone.\\n__label__1 One month only: These last about a month. Had to get total of six of them for my parents to last through the winter. Guessing this is their profit strategy.\\n__label__2 Definitely recommend: I ran outside the entire winter with these on my sneakers and they work awesome in the snow and ice. I did go through a pair but with as much as I used them, it was to be expected.\\n__label__2 Great Safeguard against ice: I only got to use these once before all the snow melted, but now I feel confident that I\\'m ready for next year. I ride at a local barn and even where paths have been plowed, it\\'s often slippery. I keep the YakTrax with my tack. They are easy to slip on over my riding boots, and I feel secure enough to fetch the horse from the paddock, as well as make trips between my car and the barn. When I am done, I can slip the YakTrax off, rinse them off when I clean my boots, and they are ready for the next use. I had already fallen flat on my back earlier this winter, so it was a great relief to get the YakTrax so promptly after ordering them.\\n__label__1 Indiferent product; laudable service: Bought the two dvd set. The exercises were a bit softer than what I was looking for; seemed to be aimed at continous gentle movement rather than stretching into and maintaining positions. There did seem to be the advertised several hours of viewing. However the menu navigation did not respond well either to playing on my computer or my dedicated dvd player; gave up trying after a while.Contacted the producer and prompt restitution was made. Five stars for service.\\n__label__2 Revealing: I knew one woman at work was trash talking about me and the book \\'Bully In Sight\\' suggested there was a co-bully involved. This book helped me understand and identify the co-bully, Middle Bee, and what her function was in the scheme of things. She was someone I thought was a friend, pumping me for information which she fed back to the \\'Queen Bee\\'. It also helped me recognize who the Afraid-to-Bees were and cut them all off. I now understand their ways well enough to go forward and turn them all in to management should they start mis-behaving again..... towards ANY ONE in my organization, not just me.\\n__label__1 Simply yuck!: It does not taste well. I was expecting real sprouts and better seasoning but it was not simply that great.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t waste your money: I think Hot Wheels has some great stuff out there....but this is definately NOT one of them. Putting it together is a pain in the neck..it\\'s very hard to click every together and the instructions could not be more unclear. (be aware that the pieces do not come out again, so you\\'re stuck with this large contraption to store afterwards). There is only one function...pull the truck back on the lever and try to hit the monster\\'s chest....so we did....but it was virtually impossible to do. The truck keeps falling in the \"pit\" and gets eaten every time. It\\'s just poorly designed. It\\'s VERY loud and my intelligent 5-year old stopped playing after 10 minutes.\\n__label__2 The Running Man (Special Edition): My husband is a great Arnie fan and enjoys any of his movies. This is just another example of another.\\n__label__2 Varley\\'s best collection.: If you\\'re tired of namby-pamby upbeat SF in \"future perfect\" tense, this book is for you. I can\\'t believe it is out of print! It should be required reading for any true fan of science fiction. The stories are enthralling; the characters\\' lives are compelling. You\\'ll lose yourself in Varley\\'s vision.\\n__label__1 dreadful video playback: Netflix, et al. work great at our home. BUT!!! amazon video sucks. this movie was unwatchable it was such bad video quality.\\n__label__1 does not last: I bought this \"heavy duty UV treated\" tarp to cover some equipment that gets Virginia sun two-thirds of the day. Less than a year later it was completely rotted away. I bought a second tarp off Amazon not realizing I was ordering the same one (the \"heavy-duty UV treated\" sold me again). Same thing happened....it is 9 months later and the tarp is rotting out with holes a couple of feed across. So unless you intent to use this in the shade to protect only from rain, I\\'d suggest a different brand.\\n__label__2 bbq grill cover: Well worth the extra money...My grill is like another child to me...only the best best best best best best best\\n__label__1 Where were the funny parts??: The glowing reviews on the cover made this book sound like a fun read. It wasn\\'t. This book really challenged my attention span, I kept wondering if it was ever going to get better. Summary: Mischevious writer sets up another one to be murdered, just for fun. The hit men, completely unbelievable cultured theatre lovers turn out to be the nicest people in the story. This was the first Martha Grimes I have read and I am in no hurry to try another. I happen to love subtle humor, but this was so subtle I missed it.\\n__label__1 Arbitrary conclusions; difficult to read: There aren\\'t many books I just don\\'t like, but this was one. Rapaille comes across as an elitist who\\'s tricked everyone into believing he\\'s a guru. I would compare Rapaille to some know-it-all \\'expert\\' at the art gallery who raves about the artist\\'s use of light, color, and internal meaning, only to find out later that the painting was done by an elephant with a brush in its trunk (i.e. waaaay too much meaning assigned to random things). The same is true here. Rapaille\\'s conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable, and you or I could spout the same arbitrary theories. For example, because Americans consume a lot of hamburgers, I hereby declare that the culture code for America is a cow. See? It\\'s easy. This type of random link between unrelated things (and the unsupportable claim that they\\'re not random and they ARE related)is what you get with this book. Rapaille\\'s only genius is in convincing corporate America that he is one.\\n__label__1 Too short, no elasticity: Title pretty much covers it. They are WAY too short so the wrist/knuckle coverage is minimal, and there is no elasticity so you can\\'t get a tight, secure fit. Don\\'t bother.\\n__label__2 Aly and AJ, the best!!!!!!!!: Amazing!!!!!!! I haven\\'t even bought the cd yet and I\\'m addicted to it!!!!! I go on websites to listen to samples of the songs.Ratings-Rush (5/5)No one (4 & 3/4/5)Collapsed (5/5)Something More (5/5)On The Ride (5/5)Speak For Myself (5/5)Out of The Blue (4 & 3/4/5)In a Second (5/5)I Am One Of Them (5/5)Sticks And Stones (5/5)Protecting Me (5/5)Slow Down (5/5)Do You Believe In Magic (4 & 3/4/5)Walking On Sunshine (5/5)That was my review. Hope it helped you out! Alexandra\\n__label__2 how did you and your sister start singing together: how did you and your sister aj start singing together what age did you guys start\\n__label__2 how I envy their composing! Brilliant!: \"Wow. Oh my...wow.\" These are the thoughts that were going through my mind when I first listened to the whole CD of \"Into the Rush\" by Aly & AJ. It\\'s really cool to think that two girls only a little older than I can really make this kind of music. It\\'s awe inspiring. Honestly. I agree with Eri (Hong Kong), she really summed it up in her review. All I want to add, is that when you listen to this kind of music, it kind of lifts your heart up, raises your spirits, and it just makes you feel like suddenly, so many more things are possible.That probably sounds cheesy, doesn\\'t it? Isn\\'t it weird how something so cheesy, can be so true?? Please, at least listen to this CD. I\\'m telling the truth when I say that it is awesome!!\\n__label__1 Pop Doesn\\'t Get Much Worse: What do you expect from a band who\\'s main audience is Radio Disney? For some dome reason this pathetic sister duo decided to promote their music to CCM audience, they even brought on famed producer Ian Eskelin for a few songs. What does it amount to? One of the worst albums of the year. The covers throw rotten eggs at the original versions, and the stench seeps through the rest of the songs. The music is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, their voices aren\\'t anything to write home about, and the lyrics are downright pathetic. Why buy it? Don\\'t, boycott it! What\\'s Christian about this music? What\\'s even good about it? By the way, their new album only expands on the bad parts, it might be so bad, it\\'s burnable.\\n__label__1 View only with a mega screen with mega sound system: I saw this short short film - years ago at a theatre. At that time this short was a as prelude to a feature length film and it was unique at that time and thus enjoyable. Recently I this film on video on both a regular 27 inch TV and wide screen TV connected to a powerful audio system. If you do not have the wide screen TV and great audio system do not bother. The quality of this film is quite poor compared to the crystal clear clarity of most Claude Lelouch films. Plus it just does not work on the small screen. Bigger the viewing and hearing platform that more enjoyable the viewing. Au Revoir!\\n__label__1 Trailer......unplugged!: I haul a boat, enclosed utility and a snowmobile trailer and need this adapter for my Chevy Avalanche. Cheaply built and all of my flat 4 prong trailer plugs frequently work themselves loose and disconnect. Amazon offers others for a few dollars more. Pay the difference and get one of the better adapters...unless you enjoy being unplugged.\\n__label__2 Worked as they should.: One of my sons bought these extra air burst rockets and the other accessories as well. They make for a lot of fun - if you have a larger, open area.\\n__label__1 The reviews are written by the author?!!: I am merely in the process of conducting a search;but the fact that the author has written the reviews himself (and refers to himself in the third person for one review)causes this marketer to not be interested in what he has to say. How ridiculous! Note: The review requires selecting a rating. I have not actually read the content which may be quite good.\\n__label__2 Good stuff: It works surprisingly well on my 350z top. It went from gray back to black and it looks like a band new top.\\n__label__2 The Beautiful Gretchen Mol: This reviewer thought that Gretchen Mol \\'s performance in THE NOTORIOUS BETTY PAGE in the title role was spirited and breathtaking. The story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive, and it did capture a slice and time of American history/culture (the post WWII America 1950\\'s) when life seemed tame, safe, and somewhat boring? It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60\\'s counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950\\'s), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls.\\n__label__2 keeping your eye on the actor: a charming, stimulating and engrossing film that provides a surprisingly heartwarming take on an extraordinary person. As others have mentioned, the acting is superb. This ultimately satisfying film captures her innocence, her mischief and a vivid snapshot of the indulgences and controversies of the time.\\n__label__1 Great Read - Mediocre Advice: I purchased this book a little while before going to Paris and read it cover to cover, made maps, reference marks on my maps (basically went over board) believing I had invested money in a guide that was somewhat acurate. Sadly, I was mistaken - many of the stores mentioned were either no longer in business or were at another address. Most of the advice was off the cuff and not honest enough to be taken seriously by anyone. It is a fun read, don\\'t get me wrong, but more as fiction than fact. Paris is a living, breathing animal of a city, always changing - i realize now that advice, not military precision shopping, is what I am looking for, and this is not it.\\n__label__1 Musica Popular de los Andes is a Bootleg!: This CD is another of the series of bootlegs that came in from Italy in the mid \\'90s, featuring Yma Sumac. Selling (or buying) it is illegal and it has no business being available on amazon.com. All of Yma Sumac\\'s early material is owned by Capitol Records / EMI and without exception, every legitimate pressing bears their trademark while this one does not. Buy it at your own risk!\\n__label__2 I Really Enjoyed This Book!: I met Scott Haskins at his Book Reading/signing In Philadelphia a few months ago. He had his Sister do his book reading and you would have thought she was Sasha as she read with so much character and feeling. The Haskins are a very talented family. Anyway, I had to buy this book because she stops reading when Sasha opens the door to the bedroom with surpise then all hell breaks loose. I loved this book because there is a little bit of Sasha in all women. There were times I felt like taking a few of my friend\\'s/family\\'s lovers/husbands out but Sasha had enough nerve to go to the next level. She was about it, bout it! Hey Scott I look forward to seeing you at our Sistahs With A Vision August Barbecue in New Jersey. I have selected this book for my selection in both my reading groups, Busara Nayo is my other group!\\n__label__2 SASHA\\'S WAY: This book was a very good book. I couldn\\'t hardly put the book down.Sasha was a killer to her heart even though some of the men did need killing.It would have been good to have a Sasha\\'s two to see if she really did stop killing .\\n__label__1 SOMETHING DIFFERENT!: I must say this book was very...well...different from what I\\'m used to reading. And even though this review is late (as in date) I was just able to find it. Since Amamzon was sold out! The cover and the beginning chapter captured my attention, but the story line lacked something...what that is I don\\'t know!\\n__label__1 Better than live: WEll, the cd is better than their live show. I saw her band in Victoria, B.C. Canada on holiday in 1999 and Michelle Morand\\'s singing was really off key (like scratching down the chalk board off-key). I\\'m glad the MP3s are better but still I agree with another review that it needs to be polished. I really like the lyrics she wrote, maybe she could write music for other singers! She\\'s got good stories in her songs. I don\\'t think they\\'re together anymore after the cd cause I went to her website and it\\'s old stuff from 1999.\\n__label__1 Needing polish: While the content within the songs of the album are intelligent, most of the vocal tracks were surprisingly unpolished. It is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals, as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note, or to completely redo various tracks to \"cover up\" the lack of strength and range. A typical album, typical genre of low grade music styling, and just overall typical. Not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star, eh?\\n__label__1 I tried, but couldn\\'t get rid of the odor: I really wanted to love this tea kettle, it is so gorgeous! Unfortunately, like many other reviews stated, it has a bad chemical odor that just wouldn\\'t go away. I washed it, boiled 6 full pots of water, boiled a water/vinegar mix a few times, and even let lemons soak in it.The smell just wouldn\\'t go away. I made some tea and tried to ignore it but I just couldn\\'t get the chemical smell AND taste to dissipate.\\n__label__1 Returned: I bought this electric kettle and promptly returned it. The water that I boiled had a strange chemical smell (like burning plastic). I tried using vinegar, baking soda, etc. to remove the unpleasant taste, but it didn\\'t work.I purchased a Breville stainless steel electric kettle instead. There aren\\'t any unpleasant tastes with the stainless steel kettle.\\n__label__1 Good product but always breaks. Cheaply made...: I purchased two of these through a local retailer. The first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe. It would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle. It lasted for 6 months to a year. The second one I got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring (unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically). Yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass. After hearing reviews of their customer service, I haven\\'t bothered to complain about a replacement. I am looking for an alternative. I liked the product otherwise. It\\'s a shame it\\'s so cheaply or badly made.\\n__label__1 No significant improvement in awful taste after all these reviews: Unfortunately, like so many other reviewers, I am turned off and very disappointed that Capresso hasn\\'t resolved the problem of the chemical, plastic, whatever is causing the ill-taste of the water after boiling. We don\\'t know if there is any health danger as a result of whatever is causing the ill-taste. The pot is attractive and heats quickly which are great selling features, but the taste doesn\\'t let up after over a year of use. Had considered getting a new one after putting a ding in the glass but have decided against it. I\\'m done with this product. If the problem gets resolved, I\\'d purchase it again in a heartbeat!\\n__label__1 unfortunate smell: Same as others have noted. It\\'s really too bad as the kettle looks and works great otherwise. Even after a vinegar washing and several kettles the smell was still quite strong.\\n__label__2 Capresso: Sleek, quick, and looks great on the counter or the table. I have received many compliments on it. People (and em) just LOVE IT!\\n__label__1 poor build quality, still working after 2 years: I bought this in Oct 2009, and most importantly it\\'s still working. I don\\'t have any issues with chemical odor or taste that others have referred to, but there is a light accumulation of rust on the metal heating element.The workmanship quality of the kettle is very low. The handle was broken in the first couple of months, the lid no longer is attached by the hinge, and the power switch is not functioning very well any more. We definitely use it a lot, but I wouldn\\'t call anything we\\'ve done to it abuse. So, 2 stars primarily based on the build quality.\\n__label__1 Stopped working in 9 months: Great wile it worked, this unit is completely dead barely 9 months after purchasing it. Not a very good record next to my regular tea kettle that I have had for 15 years without a problem. I am hoping Amazon will do the right thing and replace it for me; I will update once I find out whether they will.\\n__label__1 I cannot get rid of the chemical smell!!!: I have used the kettle everyday for a month. I have cleaned it with soap and water repeatedly. The chemical smell and taste are still present.To think I bought this because I thought glass would be \"chemically\" safer than the plastic kettle I was using. Big mistake. I\\'m going back to my old kettle.\\n__label__2 Great: Holy Cow, I\\'m pleasantly, as in exetremely, pleasedwith this carafe. I use it for tea, my wife uses itfor coffee or whenever she needs hot water in thekitchen. Being able to see the water through the glassbody lets you judge the water temp and turn it offbefore it boils if you don\\'t want water that hot.I highly recommend this item because, as I say....mine works great.\\n__label__2 Perfect: Perfect kettle. Heats up fast (in about 4 minutes) and shuts off automatically so it doesn\\'t boil over. The kettle is beautiful also.\\n__label__1 it only lasted 8 months: Our water kettle worked well while it worked, but suddenly broke while heating the water one day. the glass shattered without any trauma or impact and all the water leaked out! Never seen that happen to a water heater before.\\n__label__2 Extraordinary water kettle: We were given the 259 model Capresso water kettle for Christmas 2011. The kettle is used every single day for making coffee in a drip coffee pot. I was amazed at how quickly the water kettle can bring cold water to boil. IT is really astonishing that water can boil that fast. I have read about the odor and yes we noticed the odor when we first used the kettle, but that subsides with use and after only 2 months we don\\'t detect any odor at all. The design and styling of this kettle is very well done and all around I would give it my highest recommendation.\\n__label__2 It\\'s Perfect!: Capresso 259.03 H2O Plus Glass Water Kettle, Polished ChromeThis electric kettle is perfect! Visually stunning, AND it works exactly as promised. I\\'ve used my first one for nearly a year, at home, and have now purchased a second one for the office. Easy to keep clean and attractive. We use it for both tea and the French press. Cannot think of one single negative to report. I read quite a few Amazon reviews before purchasing, but could not substantiate any of the negatives mentioned by a few people. The only caveat is to WATCH for the sale price!\\n__label__2 Love Capresso Glass Water Kettle: This is fantastic kettle - no elements to corrode, quick to heat, doesn\\'t take up much room on the counter.\\n__label__2 magic pink stuff *smile*: My daughter calls Glyco-Thymoline, the \"magic pink stuff\". :o) It heals sore throats in just a few hours after gargling. It is amazingly wonderful. :o) :o)\\n__label__2 An excellent guide for beginners: This book provides very useful insights into planking a model ship from a kit. The book is better organized than many books on model ship building, but does not cover complete construction from start to finish, instead pinpointing specific areas of difficulty you are likely to encounter with a variety of models and kits. The book has several lists of tools and equipment for establishing beginner, intermediate, and advanced workspaces and also provides directions for designing several specialty tools that are quite useful. The illustrations throughout are very detailed.\\n__label__2 Just Love It!: I purchased a lamp exacty like this from a local store about 5 years ago. I used it in my office. A few months ago my husband decided the floor lamp in the mudroom outside his \"newly remodeled mancave\" was no longer suitable so I offered up my Accord Floor Lamp--of course he accepted. I have been searching all over for a second one for my office--imagine my surprise to find it on Amazon. I really love this lamp because it doesn\\'t take up much space, it\\'s a perfect height next to my desk, each lamp swivals and it has two levels of brightness. Plus it\\'s sturdy enough to stand without toppling when the cat leaps across the room and hits it but it\\'s light enough for me to pickup and move.I\\'m considering replacing the guest bedroom floor lamp with one of these.\\n__label__2 Cut Quality Rivals Forrest Chopmaster: I have had this blade installed on my Bosch GCM12SD for about a month and am very happy with it. My previous blade was the Forrest Chopmaster, which is out being sharpened. The Chopmaster is an excellent blade but it\\'s typically $30-$40 more expensive than this Freud. The quality of the cuts I get from this Freud is essentially the same as I got from the Forrest blade when it was new (and sharp). The sawn face of the wood is very smooth -- almost polished-looking -- and requires minimal sanding. If I didn\\'t already own the Forrest blade, I would order a second Freud to have on hand when this one needs to be sharpened! Great blade at a great price.\\n__label__2 Nice to see some spirituality: Was wonderful to see the characters depend on spirituality for a foundation in life. It clearly illustrated the conflict, the decisions and the conclusions. The thoughts of the characters made it easier for the reader to relate to a sadly popular occurance between couples. The relationship between the children and their spirituality was also evident when the idea of religon was introduced during a time of crisis. All the while, encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth.The plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic. Definately a summer read!The only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters. Although it may not contribute to the plot, it would help give a more rounded picture of the group of friends. This may help other use this book as an example of a support group and may provide a shimmer of guidance and hope to those in such a situation.\\n__label__1 not the best episode: The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that\\'s right, as friends. Their mission is to save \"Friendship Day\" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn\\'t visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what\\'s more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.Another odd thing is that Dora\\'s voice is different. It sounds like they couldn\\'t get the same actress they normally use to do Dora\\'s voice. Dora sounds older.There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn\\'t one of them.\\n__label__1 NKJV Study Bible: I placed my order January 20,2013 here it`s February 21,2013 and I HAVEN`T yet receive my bible. It was a gift and IM STILL waiting on a arrival day.I placed an order January 20,2013, here it February 21,2013 and I Haven`t receive my bible yet. It been a month. So Im not happy at all.\\n__label__1 Loved it until it failed after only 6 weeks: This air pillow provides an adjustable amount of support, and was very comfortable under my back all night. I used it while sleeping, and loved it when I first bought it. But, here we are 6 weeks later, and the pillow is leaking air at an increasing rate. The nozzle looks fine, so maybe it leaks along a seam. I\\'m extra bummed, because it is made in USA, and I always expect good quality from us. Today I bought the OPTP Pillow which is also made by McKenzie. Costs twice as much, so maybe it is better made. Got my fingers crossed!\\n__label__2 Great Adjustable Lumbar Support: This little blow up lumbar support is perfect for travel. I use it in my car and on planes. It blows up very easily to whatever size you want. Then, when you\\'re done with it, it deflates completely flat, so it will fit into any bag, no matter how full the bag is. The first one I got had a small air leak, but it was replaced by the company.\\n__label__2 The best adhesive: Love this stuff. Keeps your lashes on all day and night. Easy application Bc it gets tacky after a while. Easy to take off with warm water.\\n__label__2 Really Nice: Shipped fast and works well. My Mom is 5\\'2\" and on the shortest setting it fits her well. The only thing is every couple of months the screws start coming loose so when you get it stop off at the auto parts store and ask for some lock tight. Just a dab on the screw and it helps keep them in place!\\n__label__1 Nearly DOA: I have two of model 25404RE3. Needed a 3rd for home office use. Ordered this \\'new\\' model by mistake. The two 25404RE3 phones work fine, but the new 25414RE3 doesn\\'t. First, the phone recognizes only line one when a two line cord is plugged into the first jack. To get it to work for my two lines, I have to plug it into the second jack and use line 3 and 4. Second, it doesn\\'t intercom at all with the 254o4RE3 models. This needs to go back!Also, FWIW I like the aesthtics of the older model better; sleeker looking buttons and less use of dark colors.\\n__label__1 Disappointing: The product performs as desired save for one huge flaw. There is a coil inside that vibrates with the side of the case and circuit board. Using the supplied solid mounts, this means you hear alot of annoying vibration. The unit is not very substantial in feel. Unless you have your music cranked all the time, or have a very noisy vehicle, you will have a constant annoying rattle.\\n__label__1 GPS for Mariners: This was a most disappointing book. It was not at all helpful and basically a waste of money.\\n__label__2 Excellent reference for traditional sailors: Execllent overview of functional and decorative marlinspike seamanship; and clearly written by a real sailorman! Not very deep in any individual area, but highly useful to the novice. I actually made a few items using the instructions, they worked\\n__label__1 Fantastic song! Too bad they messed up the CD single.: This is one of Enigma\\'s best songs in recent history. The album version has an infectious groove that will make you want to move to it. The only problem? I haven\\'t had a chance to listen to the CD single yet.Unfortunately, the CD-single contains the \"copy-controlling\" technology that can cause problems with certain car CD players (mine is one of them) and if you want to listen to this CD on a computer (while at work, for example) you are required to install some kind of player software first.Since I am not allowed to install software on the PCs at work, I am unable to listen to this CD in the car or at my office, two places that I enjoy listening to music to. Because of this restriction, and the fact that it has prohibited me from listening to the music that I have purchased, the rating is 1 star (the music may very well be 5-star worthy, but if I can\\'t listen to it, then I can\\'t rate it :-/ )\\n__label__2 Cool Watch and good quality: I bought this watch for 59$ it\\'s very nice; a perfect size for a woman. Fluorescent handles leather strap; And swiss movment. For this price it\\'s pretty good. I have it since about 3 months and wear it almost everyday.\\n__label__1 don\\'t bother: If you liked her CD \"Warm Heart in a Cold World\", (which was pretty cool acoustic music, with great songs that were interesting and worth hearing) don\\'t bother with this one. There\\'s nothing here but a wanna-be Lisa Loeb/Alanis M.\\n__label__2 Awesome Cover for my S410 camera: This cover is absolutly the best for my S410, perfectly fits my s410 and protects from scratches (Leather is pretty thick - better than i expected), people may complain about no additional pockets, but i dont see the necessacity for additional pockets for s410 or s500 cameras, i have 512 MB CF card which can hold over 300 pictures. and battery lasts practically forever, i still had charge left in the battery after 2 days of continues use and after taking about 200 pictures (more than 100 with flash). for the people looking for case with some additional pockets, they can look at some generic cases but the bulkiness of the case defeats the whole purpose of compact camera.\\n__label__2 Nice match for the camera.: For under $10, this item should have come with the camera. I bought my Canon S230 and put it in an old \"Spectralink\" phone case. That really protected the camera and fit well, but just didn\\'t look great. Then I bought my wife the SD200 camera at [...] and the case for the SD200 here at Amazon. The cases completed the cameras. I am left with the more bulky older model and my wife got the SD200. But we both have an interesting set, mine in black, hers in red. For these prices I wouldn\\'t invest in some 3rd party case. Get the genuine Canon case for your camera even if Canon doesn\\'t provide it.\\n__label__1 GOOD SEVICE TILL NOW: IVE HAD GOOD SEVICE FROM AMAZON.COM TILL NOW JAN.7 7:53PM CST.I WAS PROMISED I WOULD HAVE MY PSC-50 BY TODAY STILL NO PRODUCT.WHEN I FIND OUT WHOM IT WAS COMING FROM I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM SO YOU CAN BE CAUTIOUS OF THEM.SAD TO BE WRITING THIS REVIEW.ORDER WAS PLACED ON DEC. 25.I KNOW TIME IS ALLOWED FOR THE HOLIDAYS BUT GIVE ME A BREAK. NOW I WAS TOLD TO WAIT TILL JAN.11.BULL HOCKEY.I FINALLY GOT MY CASE OM JAN.10.THREE DAYS AFTER MY ESTAMATED DELIVERY.ITS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A GLOVE FIT CASE WITH NO PADDING.MY CANON S500 FIT PERFECTLY. I LIKE THE BELT LOOP INSTEAD OF A CLIP LIKE A PAGER BECAUSE IVE HAD PAGERS FALL OFF & BREAK.I SEE AMAZON DESNT CARRY THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE.YOU HAVE TO GET SOME WHERE ELSE.\\n__label__1 very loose: the color was acceptable, however the size was not fit enough. Therefore, the camera case will look not elegant as I thought.\\n__label__2 Nice cheap phone sys: Perfect for a small business that doesn\\'t need conference calling.Price was great, works well. Looks very nice too.Very pleased.\\n__label__1 For high school graduates: Respectable publisher, respectable series. I was expecting presentation level, scope and depth similar to Eberly\\'s \"Game Physics\". Unfortunately, mistake. This is a book for someone who just graduated from American high school and knows only so called \"algebra\" (+, -, *, / with calculator, no fractions). No question, there are such individuals, they have to learn, and for them this is pretty good book. I was fooled by impressive Table of Contents and number of pages. Was useless for me. Lesson learned: if you want Eberly\\'s quality, buy Eberly\\'s books\\n__label__2 Good for laughs: I love this show. I was so excited when they were putting it out on DVD because I thought all I had were memories. That being said, I too was very disappointed in Lionsgate for putting episodes in Season four that were already in Season Three. Like none of us would notice? I highly recommend purchasing the DVD set anyway because ALF will always be great TV, just don\\'t be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say \"I\\'ve seen this already...\" and it\\'s not because you recently watched it on actual TV.\\n__label__2 Daily serving of fruit: Nice chunks of dried pineapple. Not crazy about the sugary coating on the outside but I suppose that is to keep them from sticking together.\\n__label__2 Old Master - A Great Disc: Robert Johnson was the inspiration for generations of blues singers and blues lovers. It seems a great surprise to many that he was also the inspiration for waves of British performers who covered his songs: The Stones, Cream, Led Zep, Eric Clapton, etc., etc.So it\\'s particularly interesting to listen to this disc and hear the power of the original - and remastered to offer sound quality which far exceeds my old scratched records.A definite buy for anyone who loves the blues.\\n__label__2 I like it.: I\\'m giving this CD five stars out of five, and here\\'s why. First off, I like how Chevelle stuck to their style with this album instead of changing it up like most bands do with their sophmore albums (if anyone has listened to Jimmy Eat World\\'s new album, you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about.) I also like how the sound transitions from heavy to smoothe throughout the songs. Some bands have trouble pulling off those types of transitions, but I think Chevelle did a good job of it on this album. I was already a Chevelle fan after their first CD, and this CD does nothing to hurt that status.\\n__label__1 Might as Well be a Single!: i give Chevelle\\'s new album \"This Kind of Thinking Could do Us In\" a 1 for the 1 good song on it...\"Vitamin R\". Buy the single before you make a mistake of buying this album, cause the other tracks on this cd are junk...a 1 out of 5, TERRIBLE!!!\\n__label__1 Just wasn\\'t good: Having bought this book based on the review above, i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner. I forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential. There really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another. I found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the \"plot\" because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler. Many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn\\'t ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends. It sounds like i\\'m being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows. I only give it the second star because i actually finished it.\\n__label__2 makes great popcorn: Very easy and fast to use. I have a gas stove and have had no problem making popcorn on medium heat. I have used the butter flavored oil for added flavor. I look forward to taking this camping this summer.\\n__label__1 great idea - but not in aluminum!: We love the idea of this popper, and used it at least once a week for a year. It worked great, but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom, right in the center, and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner, we got weary. And then when it started a small fire on the burner, we threw it out. We\\'ll be replacing it with a stainless steel model (which means it will have to be a different brand).\\n__label__2 Great popcorn popper! We love it.: We bought this popcorn popper to use for our son\\'s birthday party and on boy scout camp outs but have been using it at least once a week at home since we got it in August.\\n__label__1 Whirly Pop could be so much better: We received a Whirley Pop as a Christmas gift, and love it, but the construction is very cheap. As a previous reviewer wrote - because the pot is so thin, it deforms after some use. This item would get a 4 if the pot were made of better materials - 5 if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier. A shame since the popcorn is so good!\\n__label__1 Broke after first use!: The first time I was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt! Couldn\\'t turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper! Should\\'ve lasted longer, it would\\'ve been a nice popper.\\n__label__1 Shoddy and unsafe: I bought 2 poppers, one for myself and one for a gift. I used mine about 3 times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off. I searched for 10 minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn. I never found the other pin so maybe we ate it. I sent both back as I dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin. I was so dissappointed since now I have to come up with another gift at the last minute.\\n__label__1 BIASED REVIEWS: I was interested in purchasing this popcorn maker as part of a gift set. However, when reading the reviews on Amazon.com I realized a serious problem. The reviews are biased. Look through the 79+ reviews. You\\'ll see the majority of the reviews give the product a full 5 stars (which is extremely surprising considering most reviewers are finicky), are written in the same tone/style of writing, and say what a wonderful gift this would make. Many also mention that it\\'s the best popcorn ever and they\\'ve used it for several years. Some even venture to say it only works well only if you use Wabash popcorn.If you read reviews less than 5 stars you\\'ll see all writers say this gadget broke/melted within a couple months. There is a serious bias in these reviews and I hope consumers are not being taken advantage of. Some of the high reviews may be valid but I\\'m quite certain nearly all are false...I\\'ve decided not to purchase the item.\\n__label__1 Construction could be a LOT better.....: The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It\\'s almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one\\'s hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster. I\\'m too afraid to wrestle with it again--I\\'m afraid I\\'ll burn myself.Which is a shame, because the popper really makes excellent popcorn. I\\'d buy another one if it were better-constructed and had METAL GEARS.\\n__label__1 Don\\'t buy this piece of ####: It was a great idea, it\\'s a shame a good company didn\\'t make it, can\\'t even blame it on foreigners. This piece of crap is a rip off. I did\\'t know you could make a pot out of tin foil, calling it flimsy would be a compliment. As soon as you assemble it and turn the handle once to see how it works, you\\'ve made a dimple in the bottom of the pot and best of all you can press it back into shape with your fingernail and no effort. The plastic gearing for the turning handle might last 4 or 5 uses. The only thing that was well made was the wooden handle. I guess they were out of balsa wood that day.DON\\'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Save your money for good popcorn at the theatre.\\n__label__2 Way better than microwave popcorn: The WhirleyPop makes great tasting popcorn, really quickly. It\\'s not much more trouble than microwave popcorn in about the same amount of time, and the results are *far* superior to microwave. It\\'s also a lot of fun to use!\\n__label__1 not sturdy enough: The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip. Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper. Worked great for first year of average or less use but now, pretty intermittant and a really, more pain than worth. I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans. We shake, not crank, now. Won\\'t buy another as it\\'s unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills.\\n__label__2 Even works will cooking spray! Toasts other items (inca corn): I really love this thing. Someone was giving one away, and I was surprised to see it on amazon! I love mine. I actually gave away my microwave popcorn popper because I ave this. I feel better eating something not microwaved, and it is just as fast! I toasted that inca corn with it. It came out great! Much lower in calories than if I fried it like the packet said. I dont even pour oil, I just use oil spray (try a misto! That would be best). When you pop with no oil, just spray a little oil spray on the popcorn afterward, to make salt stick.\\n__label__2 Good Eatin\\'!: I love this popper!! It is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack. I purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only ONCE since then. Yuck! Once you prepare your popcorn with the Whirley-Popper, you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again.\\n__label__1 Something is wrong here: I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville\\'s Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it.\\n__label__2 Best popcorn: This makes the best popcorn I\\'ve had and with only a teaspoon or so of oil.I have used mine for about 10 years but I think it is time for it to be replaced. It only has one small dent and a nice \"patina\" on the inside but the gears are finally giving out. I have a new one that I had bought for gift-giving purposes but I think it will be staying with me while the old one is \"retired.\"I have more than gotten mine money\\'s worth although now I am spoiled and won\\'t eat microwave popcorn any more.\\n__label__1 WhirlyPop popper is kinda cheezy: Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy.\\n__label__2 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper: Product works fine although it looks fragile, pay attention to instructions, use med-high heat for popping and turn crank slowly, great with white pop corn as well as yellow. Easy clean up.Would not recommend theater type popcorn initially supplieds\\n__label__2 whirley Pop: We love this, popcorn cooks real nice and fluffy in this pan easy to use. hand crank is easy to use and located in a easy to reach place.\\n__label__1 not impressed: this takes up too much cabinet space for it\\'s usefulness. i much prefer my hotair popper. it is awkward to hold on to and if you use some of their crazy recipes that include sugar or other sticky ingredients, it is a pain to clean.i really do not care for this item.\\n__label__1 Gear mechanism broke after about 5 uses.: This popper made terrific tasting popcorn, but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic, and broke afterI used the pan about 5 times. The pan heats up very hot, and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism.They should of used metal.\\n__label__2 Remind me of my childhood!: I gave this to my 76 year old grandmother for a gift because she can not use the microwave due to a pacemaker. She loved it and is always making popcorn now. The popcorn that came with it was the best popcorn we ever tasted. The only problem she has is that it is hard to use when she is having problems with her hands. She says \"I love it no matter if my hand hurts!\" LOL\\n__label__2 best popcorn popper ever: I have used several poppers, auto, air etc.. This is the best! Yes, you have to stand over it for 3 to 4 minutes but it pops almost every kernel. I have used the cheapest corn and the best-same results. You have to follow the instructions otherwise you will writing a negative review. It works as designed! I would buy this again or as a gift for anybody!\\n__label__2 Great Product!: This is the one I had originally for over a year till it fell off the top of the fridge and the lid broke. Very sad for us because we love popcorn! I tried a different version of a different brand from Fleet Farm and that one was terrible! Whirley-Pop is the way to go!\\n__label__2 Electric blue!: I\\'m a HUGE fan of SFX - it goes on well and has staying power. The colors stay bright after repeated washing and they don\\'t bleed on to everything. Love this shade for a bright blue.\\n__label__2 Study-worthy.: I found this in an effort to lead a Women\\'s study on women in ministry. I had dug long and hard to find a concise review of various impacting Christian-women\\'s tales all in one place. It is hard to find Christian women biographies - esp of Living women. I appreciate the author\\'s research (and that she narrowed to 12 women, when she interviewed many more).Each chapter is a very brief overview of each woman, but it shows us Christian women who are all over world and most are still ALIVE! In our study, we\\'ve noticed how powerfully God uses women - in many different ways, in all countries. Each woman in book seems to start small, ask God for guidance, then He helps them see more of His Big vision and we see how they act on it.Not amazingly written, and each bio may bring up more questions than it answers, but it\\'s a start for world-perspective on being a Christian.\\n'"
